Platform.sh offers a number of project templates as part of the Project Creation Wizard to help bootstrap a new project.
However, you can also create arbitrary links to spawn projects on Platform.sh from an arbitrary Git repository or prepared template.

There are two ways to create such a link, shown below.
In each case, when a user clicks on the link they will be redirected to create a new Platform.sh project,
with the template selection step skipped in favor of the template specified.
If the user does not have a Platform.sh account yet they will be prompted to create one.

You may include the link on your own project's website, your company's internal Wiki,
or anywhere else a link can go to make launching your code base as straightforward as possible.

## Preparation

To have a deployable template, you need to first prepare the repository.
The Deploy on Platform.sh button will work with any Git repository that is deployable on Platform.sh;
that is, it has the necessary [`.platform.app.yaml`](/configuration/app/_index.md),
[`.platform/services.yaml`](/configuration/services/_index.md),
and [`.platform/routes.yaml`](/configuration/routes/_index.md) files in place.
See the appropriate documentation for how to define those files.

The repository must be available at a publicly accessible Git URL.
That may be hosted with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, your own custom Git hosting,
or any other publicly accessible Git URL.

### (Optional) Make a template definition file

You can create a Deploy on Platform.sh button for any compatible repository;
however, you can also provide a YAML template definition file.
A template definition file is a YAML file that references a Git repository but can also include additional information,
such as limiting the resulting project to a certain minimum project size or only allowing it to be deployed in certain regions.
Use this mechanism when you want more control over how the template gets deployed.

The template definition file may be at any publicly accessible URL.
It can be in the template repository itself or separate.
Note that if it is in the template repository then it will be included in every deployed user project from that template.
(It won't hurt anything as it has no effect at runtime,
but users will have a copy of the file in their code base and may be confused by it.)

A list of all [Platform.sh-supported templates](https://github.com/platformsh/template-builder/tree/master/templates) is available on GitHub.
[3rd party templates](https://github.com/platformsh/templates-external/) are also available.
You can also create your own template file and host it anywhere you wish.

The template definition file's format is [documented](https://github.com/platformsh/templates-external/blob/master/template-definition.yaml)
in the 3rd party template repository.

## Making a button (with a widget)

The easiest way to make a Deploy on Platform.sh button is to use our [button builder widget](https://platform.sh/deploy/).
You provide it with either the Git URL of the repository or a URL to a corresponding template definition file.

The button builder widget will give you an HTML fragment to copy and paste to wherever you want the button hosted.
It will also include a tracking code so we can whose Deploy on Platform.sh button was clicked, but does not add any cookies to the site.

## Making a button manually

### Arbitrary Git repository

Create a link in the following form:

```text
https://console.platform.sh/projects/create-project?template=GIT_URL
```

Where `GIT_URL` is the URL of a publicly visible Git repository.
For example, to install Platform.sh's [Drupal 8 template on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal8) you would use:

```text
https://console.platform.sh/projects/create-project/?template=https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal8.git
```

(Note that is the URL of the Git repository as if you were cloning it, NOT the URL of the repository's home page on GitHub.)

A new project will be created and then initialized with whatever code is at the tip of the default branch of that repository.
This method will work for any publicly visible Git repository,
provided that it includes the necessary Platform.sh YAML configuration files.
If those are missing the project will still initialize but fail to build.

### Defined Template

Create a link in the following form:

```text
https://console.platform.sh/projects/create-project?template=TEMPLATE_URL
```

Where `TEMPLATE_URL` is the URL of a publicly visible template definition file.
For example, to install Platform.sh's [Drupal 8 template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal8) you would use:

```text
https://console.platform.sh/projects/create-project/?template=https://github.com/platformsh/template-builder/blob/master/templates/drupal8/.platform.template.yaml
```

A new project will be created, initialized with whatever code is at the tip of the default branch of the repository referenced by that file,
provided that it includes the necessary Platform.sh YAML configuration files.
If those are missing the project will still initialize but fail to build.

## Listing a repository

Platform.sh welcomes project templates produced by the application vendor.
If you have a Free Software application you want available in the Platform.sh setup wizard,
create a template definition file and submit a pull request against the [3rd party templates repository](https://github.com/platformsh/templates-external/).
The Developer Relations team will review and evaluate the application and template, and may offer feedback before merging.
Generally speaking, we welcome any Free Software application that is actively maintained and runs well on Platform.sh.
Projects released under a non-Free license will not be accepted.
