  All of our Dedicated clusters are monitored 24/7 to ensure uptime and to measure server metrics such as available disk space, memory and disk usage, and several dozen other metrics that give us a complete picture of the health of your applicationâ€™s infrastructure.

{{% description %}}

Alerting is set up on these metrics, 
so if any of them goes outside of normal bounds an operations engineer can react accordingly
to maintain the uptime and performance of your cluster.

These alerts are sent to Platform.sh support and operations teams,
and aren't directly accessible to you.

## Monitoring systems

Platform.sh uses internally developed tooling to collect metrics and to alert Platform.sh staff if any of these metrics goes out of bounds. 
When an outage is detected, a point in time report is generated. 
This report is used by the Platform.sh support team to triage the cause of the outage.
These tools are internal Platform.sh tools only.
A third-party availability monitoring system is configured for every Dedicated project.

## Application performance monitoring

Platform.sh offers application performance monitoring (APM) packaged with infrastructure monitoring in the Platform.sh Observability Suite.
This APM relies on [Blackfire.io](../../increase-observability/integrate-observability/blackfire.md#on-dedicated-gen-2-infrastructure),
which uniquely combines monitoring, profiling, and performance testing technologies.

The Observability Suite is currently available only to Enterprise, Elite, and Fleet customers.
The Observability Suite package includes all Blackfire features, support, and usage that scales with your needs.
If you are a Enterprise, Elite, or Fleet customer and want to add the Observability Suite, [contact Sales](https://platform.sh/contact/).

All customers can also [subscribe to Blackfire separately](https://www.blackfire.io/pricing).
This lets you benefit from all of its features on Platform.sh.
When purchased separately, features and usage may cost more than the equivalent bundled in the Observability Suite.

By using Blackfire on Platform.sh, you benefit from an enhanced experience and support as well as upcoming unique features.
You can contact your sales representative to get a quote for whatever size cluster is running your application.

Platform.sh also [supports New Relic APM](../../increase-observability/integrate-observability/new-relic/_index.md#on-a-dedicated-gen-2-cluster).
After you have signed up with New Relic and gotten your license key,
open a support ticket so that it can be installed on your project.
New Relic infrastructure monitoring isn't supported.

## Availability incident handling procedure

Automated monitoring may trigger alerts that page the on-call engineer or the end-user may file an urgent priority ticket.
Opsgenie pages the on-call engineer using several methods.
The on-call engineer responds to the alerts and begins to triage the issue.

Cloud infrastructure issues are handled by the customer success team.
*Application problems are escalated to an application support specialist if an agreement is part of the customer subscription.
Otherwise, they are returned to the user and may be downgraded*.

When a Urgent/High issue is escalated, it pages the on-call application support specialist.
Application support may also escalate infrastructure issues back as Urgent/High.
