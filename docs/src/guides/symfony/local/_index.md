    Sync Platform.sh with your local environments to start contributing.

A significant amount of work developing Symfony takes place locally rather than on an active Platform.sh environment.
You want to ensure that the process of local development is as close as possible to a deployed environment.

You can achieve this through various approaches.
Each of these examples:

- Creates a local development environment for a Symfony site using [Symfony Server](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/symfony_server.html)
- Syncs data from the active Platform.sh environment where team review takes place.
- Commits aspects of that local development method to the project so collaborators can replicate configuration to contribute.
