[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python framework for websites
that facilitates creating websites through rapid development.

See an example Django project in the official [Platform.sh Django template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/django4).
You can use it as a starting point for your own project.

If you already have a Django project ready to deploy,
see the template's [example Platform.sh files](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/django4/tree/master/.platform).
These files let you [configure your app](../../create-apps/_index.md),
[add services](../../add-services/_index.md), and [define routes](../../define-routes/_index.md).
