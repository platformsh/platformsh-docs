# Using Docksal for local development

[Docksal](https://docksal.io) is a docker based local development tool that plays nicely with Platform.sh.
It is maintained by a community of developers and is a viable option for most Platform.sh projects.

See the [Docksal documentation](https://docs.docksal.io/) for installing and setting up Docksal on your system.

Docksal asks you to create a `.docksal` directory in your application root,
which functions similarly to the `.platform.app.yaml` file.
It's safe to check this directory into your Git repository as Platform.sh ignores it.

Docksal Fin (`fin`) is a command line tool for controlling Docksal and used for interacting with a Docksal project.
For more information on the use of the `fin` command, use the `help` command to get all available commands and options.

```bash
fin help
```

## Using Platform.sh CLI within Docksal

The `SECRET_PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN` must be set to use the Platform.sh CLI within your Docksal project.
This is an API Token found with your Platform.sh account
and can be generated by going to the [API Tokens](https://accounts.platform.sh/user/api-tokens) page
and clicking the `Create API Token` link.
This enables you to interact with your Platform.sh account from within the CLI container.

```bash
fin config set --global SECRET_PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=XXX
```

## Pulling a Platform.sh project

The Docksal CLI ships with the Platform.sh CLI tool.
To use the tool and pull a project locally, make sure you have uploaded your SSH key to your Platform.sh account.
Once that's done and a `SECRET_PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN` has been added using the above step,
you can set up your project with the following instructions.

Note: Replace `<PROJECT_ID>` with your project's ID, which can found within the Platform.sh dashboard.
Replace `<PROJECT_DIRECTORY>` with the name of the local directory you'd like the project cloned into.
Replace `<BRANCH_NAME>` with the name of the environment you're working on.

If you do not already have Platform.sh CLI installed locally, you can use the one in the CLI image.
The advantage of this would mean that the tool would never have to be installed locally and therefore is one less dependency.

```bash
fin run-cli 'platform get <PROJECT_ID> -e <BRANCH_NAME> <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>'
```

If you already have Platform.sh CLI installed locally, you can use that instead.

```bash
platform get <PROJECT_ID> -e <BRANCH_NAME> <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
```

## Initializing a Platform.sh project

To start a new Docksal project, initialize the configuration with the `fin config generate` command and specify the `docroot` flag.

```bash
fin config generate --docroot=web
fin project start
```

The `web` directory is one of the many different items that can be set for the document.
If this is different or changes over time running the following will fix this.

```bash
fin config set docroot=XXX # Replacing XXX with the new document root.
```

## Customizing a Platform.sh project

By default, Docksal comes configured with a PHP 7.1 container, an Apache 2.4 web container, and a MySQL 5.6 database container.
Additional versions are available in the images
and you can set the desired versions by setting following variables within your `.docksal/docksal.env` file.

```text
# Apache Versions 2.2 / 2.4
#WEB_IMAGE='docksal/web:2.1-apache-2.2'
WEB_IMAGE='docksal/web:2.1-apache-2.4'

# MySQL Version: 5.6 / 5.7 / 8.0
#DB_IMAGE='docksal/db:1.2-mysql-5.6'
DB_IMAGE='docksal/db:1.2-mysql-5.7'
#DB_IMAGE='docksal/db:1.2-mysql-8.0'

# PHP Versions Available 5.6 / 7.0 / 7.1 / 7.2
#CLI_IMAGE='docksal/cli:2.5-php5.6'
#CLI_IMAGE='docksal/cli:2.5-php7.0'
CLI_IMAGE='docksal/cli:2.5-php7.1'
#CLI_IMAGE='docksal/cli:2.5-php7.2'
```

You can further create and customize a `.docksal/docksal.yml` file within your project.
This is a docker-compose file and can be customized as needed for your application,
as some customizations are specific to certain applications.
See Docksal documentation on [extending stock images](https://docs.docksal.io/stack/extend-images).

## Downloading MySQL data from Platform.sh into Docksal

In most cases, downloading data from Platform.sh and loading it into your project is straightforward.
The following commands, run from your application root, download a compressed database backup
and load it into the local Docksal database container.

```bash
fin platform db:dump --gzip -f /tmp/database.sql.gz
fin exec 'zcat < /tmp/database.sql.gz | mysql -u user -puser -h db default'
```

### Connecting Projects to the Database

After importing your database into the project the next step is connecting to the database server.
The following information can be used for setting up a connection for your application.

Key | Value
----|-----
DB Name | default
Username | user
Password | user
Host | db
Port | 3306

See the [exporting tutorial](/tutorials/exporting.md) for information on how to use rsync.
