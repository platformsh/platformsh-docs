  Once you have an environment running, there are many ways to access it to perform needed tasks. The most straightforward way is to view it in a web browser; the available URLs are shown in the Platform.sh management console and on the command line after every Git push.

By design, the only way to deploy new code is to push to the corresponding branch.
That ensures a consistent, repeatable, auditable application instance at all times.

## Visiting the site on the web

To find the URLs to access your site, follow these steps:

{{< codetabs >}}

---
title=In the console
file=none
highlight=false
---

<!--This is in HTML to get the icon not to break the list. -->
<ol>
  <li>Select the project where you want to find the URLs.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Environment</strong> menu, select an environment.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>URLs</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<--->

---
title=Using the CLI
file=none
highlight=false
---

Run the following command:

```bash
platform url --project <PROJECT_ID>
```

{{< /codetabs >}}

Generally there are two URLs created per route in your `routes.yaml` file:
One HTTPS and one HTTP route that just redirects to HTTPS.
If you're using the `{all}` placeholder in your `routes.yaml` file,
then there are more, depending on how many domains you have configured in your project.

## Access your app with SSH

See how to [access apps with SSH](./ssh/_index.md#connect-to-apps)

The application container is a fully working Linux environment using the `bash` shell.
Most of the system consists of a read-only file system so you can't edit code, but the full system is available to read.
Any file [mounts](../configuration/app/app-reference.md#mounts)
you have declared in your [app configuration](../configuration/app/_index.md) are writable.

Additionally, you are logged in as the same user that the web server runs as.
So you don't have to worry about editing a file from the command line and from your application
resulting in inconsistent and broken file ownership and permissions.

## Uploading and downloading files

The writable static files in an application (including uploads and temporary and private files)
are stored in [mounts](../configuration/app/app-reference.md#mounts).

The Platform.sh CLI can list mounts inside an application:

```bash
$ platform mounts
Mounts in the app drupal (environment main):
+-------------------------+----------------------+
| Path                    | Definition           |
+-------------------------+----------------------+
| web/sites/default/files | shared:files/files   |
| private                 | shared:files/private |
| tmp                     | shared:files/tmp     |
+-------------------------+----------------------+
```

The CLI also helps in transferring files to and from a mount using the `mount:upload` and `mount:download` commands.
These commands use the rsync utility, which in turn uses SSH.

For example, to download files from the 'private' mount:

```bash
$ platform mount:download --mount private --target ./private

This will add, replace, and delete files in the local directory 'private'.

Are you sure you want to continue? [Y/n]
Downloading files from the remote mount /app/private to /Users/alice/Projects/foo/private
  receiving file list ...
 done

  sent 16 bytes  received 3.73K bytes  2.50K bytes/sec
  total size is 1.77M  speedup is 471.78
  time: 0.91s
The download completed successfully.
```

Uploading files to a mount is similar:

```bash
$ platform mount:upload --mount private --source ./private

This will add, replace, and delete files in the remote mount 'private'.

Are you sure you want to continue? [Y/n]
Uploading files from /Users/alice/Projects/foo/private to the remote mount /app/private
  building file list ...
 done

  sent 2.35K bytes  received 20 bytes  1.58K bytes/sec
  total size is 1.77M  speedup is 745.09
  time: 0.72s
The upload completed successfully.
```

## Using SSH clients

Many applications and protocols run on top of SSH,
including the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), secure copy (scp), and rsync.
You need to set up [SSH keys](./ssh/ssh-keys.md) and let your client access the private key.

Then [get the SSH connection details](./ssh/_index.md#get-ssh-connection-details) for the environment.
Enter the host and username into your client.

### SFTP

SFTP is another way to upload and download files to and from a remote environment.
There are many SFTP clients available for every operating system.

### scp

scp is a basic command-line utility to copy files to and from a remote environment.

For example, to download a `diagram.png` file from the `web/uploads` directory (relative to the application root),
run the following command (replacing `<PROJECT_ID>` and `<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>` with appropriate values):

```bash
scp "$(platform ssh --pipe -p <PROJECT_ID> -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>)":web/uploads/diagram.png .
```

The file is copied to the current local directory.

To copy files from your local directory to the Platform.sh environment, reverse the order of the parameters:

```bash
scp diagram.png "$(platform ssh --pipe -p <PROJECT_ID> -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>)":web/uploads
```

Consult the [scp documentation](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html) for other options.

### rsync

For copying files to and from a remote environment, rsync is the best tool available.
It's a little more complicated to use than scp, but it can also be a lot more efficient,
especially if you are only updating files that are already partially copied.

The CLI [`mount:upload` and `mount:download` commands](#uploading-and-downloading-files)
are helpful wrappers around rsync that make it a little easier to use.

You can also use rsync on its own.
For example, to copy all files in the `web/uploads` directory on the remote environment to the local `uploads` directory,
run the following command (replacing `<PROJECT_ID>` and `<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>` with appropriate values):

```bash
rsync -az "$(platform ssh --pipe -p <PROJECT_ID> -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>)":web/uploads/ ./uploads/
```

Note that rsync is very sensitive about trailing `/` characters.
Consult the [rsync documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html) for more details.

See the guides on [migrating](../tutorials/migrating.md) and [exporting](../tutorials/exporting.md) for more examples using rsync.
