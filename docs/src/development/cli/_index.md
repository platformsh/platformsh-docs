The CLI uses the git interface and the [Platform.sh REST API](https://api.platform.sh/docs/) to accomplish tasks.
Its source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli).

## Before you begin

You need to have:

* PHP 5.5.9+
* Git
* A Bash-like shell

  On Windows, the best way to get Bash is through [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/about).
  You can also use another Bash-compatible shell such as [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/),
  which you might have installed with git.

For full requirements, see the [requirements on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli#requirements).

## 1. Install

Install the CLI using this command:

```bash
curl -fsS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php
```

If you run into issues or want to install manually, see the [installation instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli#installation).

## 2. Authenticate

To see and manage projects, you need to be authenticated with Platform.sh
Run this command:

```bash
platform
```

You are asked to log in via a browser.
This process creates SSH certificates on your computer for secure connections.
(See more about [SSH connections](/development/ssh/_index.md).)

Once you are logged in, a list of your projects appears, along with some tips for getting started.

If you experience authentication issues or want to force a login, run the command `platform login`.

## 3. Use

Now you can run actions on your projects such as branching and merging.
You can also simulate a local build of your codebase as if you were pushing a change to Platform.sh,
including your services and data.

To see all available commands, run `platform list`.
To get more information on a particular command, preface that command with `help`:

```bash
$ platform help get
Command: project:get
Aliases: get
Description: Clone a project locally

Usage:
 platform get [-e|--environment ENVIRONMENT] [--depth DEPTH] [--build] [-p|--project PROJECT] [--host HOST] [-i|--identity-file IDENTITY-FILE] [--] [<project>] [<directory>]

Arguments:
  project                            The project ID
  directory                          The directory to clone to. Defaults to the project title

Options:
  -e, --environment=ENVIRONMENT      The environment ID to clone. Defaults to the project default, or the first available
                                     environment
      --depth=DEPTH                  Create a shallow clone: limit the number of commits in the history
      --build                        Build the project after cloning
  -p, --project=PROJECT              The project ID or URL
      --host=HOST                    The project's API hostname
  -i, --identity-file=IDENTITY-FILE  An SSH identity (private key) to use
  -h, --help                         Display this help message
  -q, --quiet                        Do not output any message
  -V, --version                      Display this application version
  -y, --yes                          Answer "yes" to any yes/no questions; disable interaction
  -n, --no                           Answer "no" to any yes/no questions; disable interaction
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose               Increase the verbosity of messages

Examples:
 Clone the project "abc123" into the directory "my-project":
   platform get abc123 my-project
```

### Select the right project and environment

When you are in an empty directory or a directory not associated with a specific Platform.sh project,
if you run a command that requires a specific project and environment, you are prompted to select them.

```bash
$ platform environment:info
Enter a number to choose a project:
  [0] My project (xb3pfo734qxbeg)
  [1] A great project (3p5fmol45kxp6)
  [2] An even better project (rjify4y564xaa)
> 
```

If your working directory is inside a local checkout of your project repository,
your project and environment are detected automatically.

You can always specify the project and environment in two ways:

* As arguments for the command:

  ```bash
  $ platform environment:info --project=my-project --environment=staging
  ```
* With environment variables:

  ```bash
  export PLATFORM_PROJECT=my-project;
  export PLATFORM_BRANCH=staging;
  platform environment:info
  ```

In [multi-app](../../configuration/app/multi-app.md) projects, this applies also to selecting the right app
(the environment variable would be `PLATFORM_APPLICATION_NAME`).

#### RootNotFoundException

If you check out a project via Git directly and not using the `platform get` command,
the CLI may be unable to determine what project it's in.
You might run a CLI command from within a project directory you've checked out and get an error like this:

```text
[RootNotFoundException] Project root not found. This can only be run from inside a project directory.
```

Then the CLI hasn't been able to determine the project to use.
To fix this, run:

```bash
platform project:set-remote <PROJECT_ID>
```

Replace `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your project.
You can find that in the management console or by running `platform projects` to list all accessible projects.

### Choose between the CLI and Git commands

Some CLI commands (especially many within the `environment` namespace) have some overlap with Git commands.
Generally, they offer more options than the Git commands alone.
For example, `platform push` offers options such as `--activate` (to active an environment before pushing)
and `--no-wait` (so you can continue working without waiting for the push to complete).

For all of them, you don't need to configure a Git remote.
It's enough to have a project ID.

An example of how this affects commands is that when you run `platform merge`,
it doesn't affect your local codebase.
You don't even need the code locally.
The code is only merged between environments remotely.

### Customize the CLI

You can customize how the CLI operates and what it returns with a configuration file (`.platform/local/project.yaml`)
or environment variables.
For details, see the [customization instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli#customization).

### Autocomplete commands

The CLI provides tab autocompletion for commands, options, and some values (your projects, valid regions).

Your system must include the `bash-completion` package or an equivalent.
This isn't available by default on macOS, but can be installed via `brew`.
Check your home directory and ensure that the file `~/.platformsh/autocompletion.sh` is being included by your shell.

If you experience issues, run `platform self:install` to attempt a reinstall of this utility.
