Available commands for the "organization" namespace:
  organization:billing:address                                  View or change an organization's billing address
  organization:billing:profile                                  View or change an organization's billing profile
  organization:create                                           Create a new organization
  organization:info                                             View or change organization details
  organization:list (orgs, organizations)                       List organizations
  organization:subscription:list (organization:subscriptions)   List subscriptions within an organization
  organization:user:add                                         Invite a user to an organization
  organization:user:delete                                      Remove a user from an organization
  organization:user:get                                         View an organization user
  organization:user:list (organization:users)                   List organization users
  organization:user:update                                      Update an organization user
```

For example, the following command would invite `alice@example.com` with the **Billing**, **Plans** and **Projects create** permissions to the `acme-corp` organization.

```bash
platform organization:user:add alice@example.com --org=acme-corp --permission=billing,plans,projects:create
```

After inviting `alice@example.com`, Alice will receive an invitation email asking to confirm her details and optionally, register for a Platform.sh account.

To update Alice's permissions in your organization, run:

```bash
platform organization:user:update alice@example.com --org=acme-corp --permission=billing
```

This command would remove all previously granted permissions from Alice, and only grant the **Billing** permission.

## Transfer project ownership

If you want to transfer a project to a different organization, please submit a support ticket from the current project to ask for the transfer.

This action will automatically transfer the subscription charges to the new organization.
