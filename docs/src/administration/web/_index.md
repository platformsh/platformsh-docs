![Overview of projects in the Console](/images/management-console/all-projects.png "0.5")

This Console offers you ways to manage projects and environments other than the [command line interface (CLI))](../cli/_index.md).

## Project list

The [main Console page](https://console.platform.sh) gives you an overview of all your projects.
You can narrow the list down by searching for specific projects or choosing a specific organization from the menu.

Once you select a project, you can [configure the project settings](./configure-project.md).
You can also choose individual environments within the project and [configure each environment](./configure-environment.md).

You can also create a new project by clicking **+ Create project**.

## Display settings

You can personalize the display settings for the Console.
To do so:

1. Open the user menu (your name or profile picture).
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Choose the mode you want.
4. Click **Save**.

The Console can be displayed in three ways:

* Light mode (default)
* High contrast mode
* Dark mode

To meet our [commitment to accessibility](/security/wcag.md),
all three options are compliant with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.
