The project timezone affects [automated backups](../dedicated-gen-2/overview/backups.md).

The project timezone doesn't affect:

- [App runtime](../create-apps/timezone.md).
- [Cron jobs](../create-apps/app-reference.md#crons).
- [System logs](../increase-observability/logs/_index.md). UTC is the default timezone for all logs.

To change the timezone for a project, follow these steps:

- Open the project where you want to change the timezone.
- Click {{< icon settings >}} **Settings**.
- Select the timezone from the list.
- Click **Save**.
