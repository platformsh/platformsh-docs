RabbitMQ is an open source message broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

See the [RabbitMQ documentation](http://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html) for more information.

## Connecting to RabbitMQ

### From your local development environment

For debugging purposes, it's sometimes useful to be able to directly connect to a service instance. You can do this using SSH tunneling. To open a tunnel, log into your application container like usual, but with an extra flag to enable local port forwarding:

```bash
ssh -L 5672:rabbitmqqueue.internal:5672 <projectid>-<branch_ID>@ssh.eu.platform.sh
```

Within that SSH session, use the following command to pretty-print your relationships. This lets you see which username and password to use, and you can double check that the remote service's port is 5672.

```bash
php -r 'print_r(json_decode(base64_decode($_ENV["PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS"])));'
```

If your service is running on a different port, you can re-open your SSH session with the correct port by modifying your `-L` flag: `-L 5672:rabbitmqqueue.internal:<remote port>`.

Finally, while the session is open, you can launch a RabbitMQ client of your choice from your local workstation, configured to connect to `localhost:5672` using the username and password you found in the relationship variable.

### Access the management plugin  (Web UI)
In case you want to access the browser-based UI, you have to use an SSH tunnel. To open a tunnel, log into your application container like usual, but with an extra flag to enable local port forwarding:

```bash
ssh -L 15672:rabbitmqqueue.internal:15672 <projectid>-<branch_ID>@ssh.eu.platform.sh
```

After you successfully established a connection, you should be able to open `http://localhost:15672` in your browser. You'll find the credentials like mentioned above.

### From the application container

The application container currently doesn't include any useful utilities to connect to RabbitMQ with. However, you can install your own by adding a client as a dependency in your `.platform.app.yaml` file.

For example, you can use [amqp-utils](https://github.com/dougbarth/amqp-utils/) by adding this:

 ```yaml
dependencies:
    ruby:
        amqp-utils: "0.5.1"
```

Then, when you SSH into your container, you can type any `amqp-` command available to manage your queues.

## Configuration

### Virtual hosts

You can configure additional [virtual hosts](https://www.rabbitmq.com/vhosts.html) to a RabbitMQ service, which can be useful for separating resources, such as exchanges, queues, and bindings, to their own namespace. In your `.platform/services.yaml` file define the names of the virtual hosts under the `configuration.vhosts` attribute:

```yaml
rabbitmq:
    type: rabbitmq:3.8
    disk: 512
    configuration:
        vhosts:
            - foo
            - bar
```
