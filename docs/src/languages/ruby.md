## Unicorn based Rails configuration

This example uses Unicorn to run a Ruby application.
You could use any Ruby application server such as Puma or Thin.

Configure the `.platform.app.yaml` file with a few key settings as listed below.
A complete example is included at the end of this section.

1. Specify the language of your application (available versions are listed above):

    {{< readFile file="/registry/images/examples/full/ruby.app.yaml" highlight="yaml" location=".platform.app.yaml" >}}

2. Setup environment variables.

   Rails runs by default on a development environment.
   You can change the Rails/Bundler via those environment variables,
   some of which are defaults on Platform.sh.

    ```yaml
    variables:
        env:
            BUNDLE_CACHE_ALL: '1'
            BUNDLE_CLEAN: '1' # /!\ if you are working with Ruby <2.7, this doesn't work well
            BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT: '1'
            BUNDLE_ERROR_ON_STDERR: '1'
            BUNDLE_WITHOUT: 'development:test'
            DEFAULT_BUNDLER_VERSION: "2.2.26" # in case none is mentioned in Gemfile.lock
            EXECJS_RUNTIME: 'Node'
            NODE_ENV: 'production'
            NODE_VERSION: v14.17.6
            NVM_VERSION: v0.38.0
            RACK_ENV: 'production'
            RAILS_ENV: 'production'
            RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT: '1' # log to /var/log/app.log
            RAILS_TMP: '/tmp'
    ```

    The `SECRET_KEY_BASE` variable is generated automatically based on the [`PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY` variable](../development/variables/use-variables.md#use-platformsh-provided-variables).
    You can change it.

3. Build your application with the build hook.

    Assuming you have your dependencies stored in the `Gemfile` at [your app root](../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory),
    create a hook like the following:

    ```yaml
    hooks:
        build: |
            set -e

            echo "Installing NVM $NVM_VERSION"
            unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
            export NVM_DIR="$PLATFORM_APP_DIR/.nvm"
            # install.sh automatically installs NodeJS based on the presence of $NODE_VERSION
            curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/$NVM_VERSION/install.sh | bash
            [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

            # we install the bundled bundler version and fallback to a default (in env vars above)
            export BUNDLER_VERSION="$(grep -A 1 "BUNDLED WITH" Gemfile.lock | tail -n 1)" || $DEFAULT_BUNDLER_VERSION
            echo "Install bundler $BUNDLER_VERSION"
            gem install --no-document bundler -v $BUNDLER_VERSION

            echo "Installing gems"
            # We copy the bundle directory to the Platform.sh cache directory for
            # safe keeping, then restore from there on the next build. That allows
            # bundler to skip downloading code it doesn't need to.
            [ -d "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/bundle" ] && \
              rsync -az --delete "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/bundle/" vendor/bundle/
            mkdir -p "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/bundle"
            bundle install
            # synchronize updated cache for next build
            [ -d "vendor/bundle" ] && \
              rsync -az --delete vendor/bundle/ "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/bundle/"

            # precompile assets
            echo "Precompiling assets"
            # We copy the webpacker directory to the Platform.sh cache directory for
            # safe keeping, then restore from there on the next build. That allows
            # bundler to skip downloading code it doesn't need to.
            mkdir -p "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/webpacker"
            mkdir -p "$RAILS_TMP/cache/webpacker"
            [ -d "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/webpacker" ] && \
              rsync -az --delete "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/webpacker/" $RAILS_TMP/cache/webpacker/
            # We dont need secret here https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/32947
            SECRET_KEY_BASE=1 bundle exec rails assets:precompile
            rsync -az --delete $RAILS_TMP/cache/webpacker/ "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/webpacker/"
        deploy: bundle exec rake db:migrate
    ```

    These are installed as your project dependencies in your environment.
    You can also use the `dependencies` key to install global dependencies.
    These can be Ruby, Python, NodeJS, or PHP libraries.

    If you have assets, it's likely that you need NodeJS/yarn.

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
        nodejs:
            yarn: "*"
    ```

4. Configure the command to start serving your application (this must be a foreground-running process) under the `web` section:

    ```yaml
    web:
        upstream:
            socket_family: unix
        commands:
            start: "bundle exec unicorn -l $SOCKET"
    ```

    This assumes you have Unicorn as a dependency in your Gemfile:

     ```ruby
    # Use Unicorn as the app server
    gem "unicorn", "~> 6.0", :group => :production
    ```

5. Define the web locations your application is using:

    ```yaml
    web:
        locations:
            "/":
                root: "public"
                passthru: true
                expires: 1h
                allow: true
    ```

    This configuration sets the web server to handle HTTP requests at `/static`
    to serve static files stored in `/app/static/` folder.
    Everything else is forwarded to your application server.

6. Create any Read/Write mounts.
   The root file system is read only.
   You must explicitly describe writable mounts.

    ```yaml
    mounts:
        "/log":
            source: local
            source_path: log
        "/storage":
            source: local
            source_path: storage
        "/tmp":
            source: local
            source_path: tmp
    ```

    This setting allows your application writing temporary files to `/app/tmp`,
    logs stored in `/app/log`, and active storage in `/app/storage`.

    You can define other read/write mounts (your application code itself being deployed to a read-only file system).
    Note that the file system is persistent and when you backup your cluster these mounts are also backed up.

7. Then, setup the routes to your application in `.platform/routes.yaml`.

    ```yaml
    "https://{default}/":
        type: upstream
        # the first part should be your project name
        upstream: "app:http"
    ```

### Complete app configuration

Here is a complete `.platform.app.yaml` file:

```yaml

        # we install the bundled bundler version and fallback to a default (in env vars above)

        source: local
        source_path: storage
    "/tmp":
        source: local
        source_path: tmp

            passthru: true
            expires: 1h
            allow: true

```

## Configuring services

This example assumes there is a MySQL instance.
To configure it, [create a service](../add-services/_index.md) such as the following:

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
database:
    type: mysql:10.4
    disk: 2048
```

## Connecting to services

Once you have a service, link to it in your [app configuration](../create-apps/_index.md):

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
    database: "database:mysql"
```

By using the following Ruby function calls, you can obtain the database details.

```ruby
require "base64"
require "json"
relationships= JSON.parse(Base64.decode64(ENV['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS']))
```

This should give you something like the following:

```json
{
   "database" : [
      {
         "path" : "main",
         "query" : {
            "is_master" : true
         },
         "port" : 3306,
         "username" : "user",
         "password" : "",
         "host" : "database.internal",
         "ip" : "246.0.241.50",
         "scheme" : "mysql"
      }
   ]
}
```

For Rails, you have two choices:

- Use the standard Rails `config/database.yml` with the values found with the snippet provided before
- Use the [platformsh-rails-helper gem](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-rails-helper)
  by adding it to your `Gemfile` and commenting the production block in `config/database.yml`

## Other tips

- To speed up boot you can use the [Bootsnap gem](https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap)
  and configure it with the local `/tmp`:

  ```ruby {location="config/boot.rb"}
  Bootsnap.setup(cache_dir: "/tmp/cache")
  ```

- For garbage collection tuning, you can read [this article](https://shopify.engineering/17489064-tuning-rubys-global-method-cache)
  and look for [discourse configurations](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker/blob/b259c8d38e0f42288fd279c9f9efd3cefbc2c1cb/templates/web.template.yml#L8)

- New images are released on a regular basis to apply security patches.
  To avoid issues when such updates are performed, use `ruby "~>3.1"` in your `Gemfile`.

## Troubleshooting

By default, deployments have `BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT=1` to ensure projects have a `Gemfile.lock` file.
This is safer for version yank issues and other version upgrade breakages.

You may encounter an error like the following during a build:

```txt
  W: bundler: failed to load command: rake (/app/.global/bin/rake)
    W: /app/.global/gems/bundler-2.3.5/lib/bundler/resolver.rb:268:in `block in verify_gemfile_dependencies_are_found!': Could not find gem 'rails (= 5.2.6)' in locally installed gems. (Bundler::GemNotFound)
```

To resolve this error:

1. Run `bundle install` with the same `ruby` and `bundler` versions defined in your `.platform.app.yaml` file.
2. Push the `Gemfile.lock` to your repository.
