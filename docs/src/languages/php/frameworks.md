Full Drush support and Composer-based builds
so you can handle dependencies and builds for PHP frameworks by committing `composer.json` to your project.

## Drupal

[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) is an open-source content management framework written in PHP.
Since Composer comes pre-installed on Platform.sh, Drupal can be installed and updated completely using Composer.
The default [build flavor](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#build) for PHP application
runs `composer install` during build, handling all of your dependencies automatically.
