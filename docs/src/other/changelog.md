## 2021

* **September 2021**
  * Organizations: Switched to [organizations](/administration/organizations.md) for managing Platform.sh projects, users, and billing.
  * Vault: Added [Vault service](/configuration/services/vault.md).
  * .Net: We now support [.Net 5.0](/languages/dotnet.md).
* **May 2021**
  * Elasticsearch 6.8: We now support [Elasticsearch 6.8](/configuration/services/elasticsearch.md).
---
* **April 2021**
  * WAF: [a new page was added](/security/waf.md) describing the filtering rule sets and protections that come with the Platform.sh WAF.
  * [Build environment variables](/development/variables.md#project-variables): environment variables can now accept the same `--visible-build` and `--visible-runtime` flags as project variables when created through the CLI. Build-visible variables are now a part of the build image ID, and therefore triggers a rebuild of the application when the value is updated. 
  * **Breaking change**: The logic by which the build image ID has changed in order to support build environment variables above. Previously, every attribute in `.platform.app.yaml` was included in the build image, used to create the unique build ID, and *accessible* via the `PLATFORM_APPLICATION` environment variable at build time. This is no longer the case, and only a subset of `.platform.app.yaml` attributes are now accessible from `PLATFORM_APPLICATION` at build time. See the [Platform.sh-provided variables](/development/variables.md#variables-available-during-builds-and-at-runtime) section for more information.
