Across all of your sites and testing pipelines and get actionable reports and insights that help you fix issues.

Blackfire grants detailed information on the resources your application consumes across
Wall-Time, CPU, I/O, Memory, Network Calls, HTTP requests ,and SQL queries.

In addition, it can profile your code automatically and notify you
whenever your application doesn't comply with best practices for PHP, Python, and most Open-Source frameworks.

Blackfire's features are powerful especially when running on Platform.sh.

{{< note >}}

Blackfire.io can be bundled with Enterprise and Elite subscriptions as part of the Observability Suite.
To learn more, [contact Sales](https://platform.sh/contact/).
All customers can also subscribe to Blackfire separately.

## Getting started

### On a Grid plan or {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} infrastructure 

If you have the Platform.sh [Observability Suite](https://platform.sh/features/observability-suite/), 
the [Blackfire automated integration](#automated-integration) is enabled on Grid environments by default. 

Otherwise, to enable Blackfire on your PHP or Python applications,
follow [the step-by-step instructions](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/paas/platformsh).

### On {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} infrastructure

Open a support ticket with the Blackfire Server ID and Server Token.
The Platform.sh support team installs it for you.

To find your server credentials,
navigate to your [organizations list](https://blackfire.io/my/organizations) > Select an Organization > Select an Environment > Go to the Settings/Environment Credentials menu.

Note: Make sure that [your CDN is configured](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/proxies/index)
to let Blackfire profile the code running on your servers.

## Automated integration

{{< partial "observability-suite/body" >}}

The Blackfire automated integration is available for Grid environments only.

When you create a new environment,
it automatically triggers the creation of a Blackfire environment with the same settings.
On this Blackfire environment, you have access to [all the features provided by Blackfire](https://www.blackfire.io/features/).
This includes monitoring, profiling, alerting, and build-related features.

When a Blackfire environment is created based on a Grid environment,
user access settings are replicated from the Platform.sh Console to Blackfire.
This includes all [access levels](https://blackfire.io/docs/up-and-running/access-management).
 
To access the Blackfire environment, each project user needs a Blackfire account.
When a project user doesn't already have a Blackfire account, 
a new one is automatically created using the user's Platform.sh credentials.
 
You might have Blackfire variables already set on your project.
In this case, the existing variables override the settings of the automated integration.

Note that to trigger the synchronization of changes to users and their access levels,
you need to redeploy the environment.

## Setting-up Blackfire Monitoring

Once Blackfire is configured on your cluster,
navigate to your [Organizations List](https://blackfire.io/my/organizations) > Select an Organization > Go to the Organization Monitoring Usage menu,
and activate Monitoring for the required environment.

Read more in the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/monitoring-cookbooks/index) about:

* Configuring alerts
* Events API
* Monitoring third-party calls
* Monitoring consumers
* Advanced settings

## Testing the performance of each new deployment

Blackfire's native integration with Platform.sh enables you to verify the performance of your application
each time you deploy a branch, in production, staging, or development.

1. Set up the [Blackfire Builds integration](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/paas/platformsh#builds-level-enterprise).
2. Optionally, set up an [integration with your Git provider](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/git/index)
   and get commit status updates from build reports.
3. [Write scenarios](https://blackfire.io/docs/builds-cookbooks/scenarios) to test business-critical use cases.

## Profiling

Blackfire lets you profile your application anywhere it is deployed,
including on your local development machines.
Using a browser extension or CLI command, profile HTTP requests, CLI scripts, Consumers, and Daemons.

Read more in the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/profiling-cookbooks/index).

## Disabling Blackfire Monitoring

Blackfire Monitoring is [enabled by default](https://blackfire.io/docs/monitoring-cookbooks/configuration#activating-monitoring-on-an-environment) for Monitoring customers.

To disable Blackfire Monitoring, create an [environment variable](../../development/variables/set-variables.md#create-environment-specific-variables).

In the Console, view the environment where you would like to disable Blackfire Monitoring
and add the variable `env:BLACKFIRE_APM_ENABLED` with the value `0`.
Otherwise, you can use the CLI command `platform variable:create --level environment --prefix env: --name BLACKFIRE_APM_ENABLED --value 0`

## Troubleshooting

### Bypassing Reverse Proxy, Cache, and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

If you are using one of these tools, you need them to let Blackfire access your servers.
Read more on [how to configure a bypass](https://blackfire.io/docs/reference-guide/reverse-proxies#documentation).

### HTTP Cache configuration

If you are using the HTTP cache with cookies,
update in your `.platform/routes.yaml` the cookies that are allowed to go through the cache.
You need to allow the `__blackfire` cookie name.

Something like:

```yaml
cache:
    enabled: true
    cookies: ["/SESS.*/", "__blackfire"]
```

## Reaching out to the Blackfire support

If the above didn't help, collect the following and send it to the [Blackfire support](https://support.blackfire.io):

* The output of `platform ssh -- php -d display_startup_errors=on --ri blackfire` command
* The Blackfire logs

### Getting the Blackfire logs

Please execute the following in the environment where you're facing the issue:

* `platform variable:create php:blackfire.log_file --value /tmp/blackfire.log`
* `platform variable:create php:blackfire.log_level --value 4`
* start a profile/build again

You can get the logs with `platform ssh -- cat /tmp/blackfire.log > blackfire.log`.

### Disabling the Blackfire logs

Once you are done, disable logging by running:

* `platform variable:delete php:blackfire.log_file`
* `platform variable:delete php:blackfire.log_level`
