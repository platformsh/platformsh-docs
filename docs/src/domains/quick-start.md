  By default, a Platform.sh app is available at a domain generated by Platform.sh. The following resources will help you take your application live on your custom domain.

{{< note theme="warning">}}

Adding a custom domain means your existing automatically generated URLs stop working.

Don't add a custom domain to your project until you're fully ready to change your DNS settings.
Until that time, continue working with the Platform.sh generated URLs.

Custom domains can only be added to the default environment on production plans (Standard or larger).

## Summary of steps

* Describe your desired future URL structure in [.platform/routes.yaml](../configuration/routes/_index.md)
* Understand [what DNS records you will need](../domains/steps/dns.md), and whether your DNS provider can support them
* Optional: [use a CDN](../domains/cdn/_index.md)
* Update your [DNS](../domains/steps/dns.md)

This short section gives a basic typical example.
See the [Step by step guide](../domains/steps/_index.md) for more complex cases.

## Set your domain

Now, add a single domain to your Platform.sh project for `mysite.com`:

{{< codetabs >}}

title=In the console
file=none
highlight=false

<!--This is in HTML to get the icon not to break the list. -->
<ol>
  <li>Select the project where you want to add a domain.</li>
  <li>Click {{< icon settings >}} <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Domains</strong>.</li>
  <li>Enter <code>mysite.com</code> into the <strong>Domain</strong> field.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>+ Add</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<--->

title=Using the CLI
file=none
highlight=false
---

Run the following command:

```bash
platform domain:add -p <PROJECT_ID> mysite.com
```

{{< /codetabs >}}

As soon as you add the domain, Platform.sh no longer serves `main-def456-abc123.eu-2.platformsh.site` at all.
Instead, `{default}` in `routes.yaml` is replaced with `mysite.com` anywhere it appears when generating routes to respond to.

You can still access the original internal domain by running `platform environment:info edge_hostname -e <BRANCH_NAME>`.

If you are planning on using subdomains across multiple projects, [the setup will differ slightly](./steps/subdomains.md).

## Configure your DNS provider

On your DNS provider, you would create two CNAMEs:

`mysite.com` should be an ALIAS/CNAME/ANAME  to `main-def456-abc123.eu-2.platformsh.site`.
`www.mysite.com` should be a CNAME to `main-def456-abc123.eu-2.platformsh.site`.

{{< note >}}
Both point to the same name. See the note above regarding how different registrars handle dynamic apex domains.

## Result

Here's what will now happen under the hood.
Assume for a moment that all caches everywhere are empty.
An incoming request for `mysite.com` will result in the following:

1. Your browser asks the DNS network for `mysite.com`'s DNS A record (the IP address of this host).
   It responds with "it's an alias for `www.main-def456-abc123.eu-2.platformsh.site`" (the CNAME),
   which itself resolves to the A record with IP address `1.2.3.4` (or whatever the actual address is).
   By default DNS requests by browsers are recursive, so there is no performance penalty for using CNAMEs.
3. Your browser sends a request to `1.2.3.4` for domain `mysite.com`.
4. Your router responds with an HTTP 301 redirect to `www.mysite.com` (because that's what `routes.yaml` specified).
5. Your browser looks up `www.mysite.com` and, as above, gets an alias for `www.main-def456-abc123.eu-2.platformsh.site`, which is IP `1.2.3.4`.
6. Your browser sends a request to `1.2.3.4` for domain `www.mysite.com`.
   Your router passes the request through to your application which in turn responds with whatever it's supposed to do.

On subsequent requests, your browser knows to connect to `1.2.3.4` for domain `www.mysite.com` and skip the rest.
The entire process takes only a few milliseconds.
