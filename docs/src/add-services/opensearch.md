See the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/1.2/) for more information.

To switch from Elasticsearch, follow the same procedure as for [upgrading](#upgrading).

## Supported versions

<!--
To update the versions in this table, use docs/data/registry.json
-->
| Grid | {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} | {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------------ |
|  {{< image-versions image="opensearch" status="supported" environment="grid" >}} | {{< image-versions image="opensearch" status="supported" environment="dedicated-gen-3" >}} | {{< image-versions image="opensearch" status="supported" environment="dedicated-gen-2" >}} |

From version 2, you only specify the major version.
The latest compatible minor version and patches are applied automatically.

{{% image-versions-legacy "opensearch" %}}

{{% relationship-ref-intro %}}

{{% service-values-change %}}

{{< relationship "opensearch" >}}

## Usage example

{{% endpoint-description type="opensearch" noApp=true /%}}

{{< note >}}

When you create an index on OpenSearch,
don't specify the `number_of_shards` or `number_of_replicas` settings in your OpenSearch API call.
These values are set automatically based on available resources.

## Authentication

By default, OpenSearch has no authentication.
No username or password is required to connect to it.

You may optionally enable HTTP Basic authentication.
To do so, include the following in your `services.yaml` configuration:

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
search:
    type: opensearch:1.2
    disk: 2048
    configuration:
        authentication:
            enabled: true
```

That enables mandatory HTTP Basic auth on all requests.
The credentials are available in any relationships that point at that service,
in the `username` and `password` properties.
{{% service-values-change %}}

This functionality is generally not required if OpenSearch isn't exposed on its own public HTTP route.
However, certain applications may require it, or it allows you to safely expose OpenSearch directly to the web.
To do so, add a route to `routes.yaml` that has `search:opensearch` as its upstream
(where `search` is whatever you named the service in `services.yaml`).
For example:

```yaml {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://os.{default}":
    type: upstream
    upstream: search:opensearch
```

## Plugins

OpenSearch offers a number of plugins.
To enable them, list them under the `configuration.plugins` key in your `services.yaml` file, like so:

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
search:
    type: "opensearch:1.2"
    disk: 1024
    configuration:
        plugins:
            - analysis-icu
            - mapper-size
```

In this example you'd have the ICU analysis plugin and the size mapper plugin.

If there is a publicly available plugin you need that isn't listed here, [contact support](../overview/get-support.md).

### Plugin removal

Removing plugins previously added in your `services.yaml` file doesn't automatically uninstall them from your OpenSearch instances.
This is deliberate, as removing a plugin may result in data loss or corruption of existing data that relied on that plugin.
Removing a plugin usually requires reindexing.

To permanently remove a previously enabled plugin,
[upgrade the service](#upgrading) to create a new instance of OpenSearch and migrate to it.
In most cases it isn't necessary as an unused plugin has no appreciable impact on the server.

## Upgrading

The OpenSearch data format sometimes changes between versions in incompatible ways.
OpenSearch doesn't include a data upgrade mechanism as it's expected that all indexes can be regenerated from stable data if needed.
To upgrade (or downgrade) OpenSearch, use a new service from scratch.

There are two ways to do so.

### Destructive

In your `services.yaml` file, change the version *and* name of your OpenSearch service.
Then update the name in the `.platform.app.yaml` relationships block.

When you push that to Platform.sh, the old service is deleted and a new one with the new name is created with no data.
You can then have your application reindex data as appropriate.

This approach has the downsides of temporarily having an empty OpenSearch instance,
which your application may or may not handle gracefully, and needing to rebuild your index afterward.
Depending on the size of your data that could take a while.

### Transitional

With a transitional approach, you temporarily have two OpenSearch services.
Add a second OpenSearch service with the new version a new name and give it a new relationship in `.platform.app.yaml`.
You can optionally run in that configuration for a while to allow your application to populate indexes in the new service as well.

Once you're ready to switch over, remove the old OpenSearch service and relationship.
You may optionally have the new OpenSearch service use the old relationship name if that's easier for your app to handle.
Your application is now using the new OpenSearch service.

This approach has the benefit of never being without a working OpenSearch instance.
On the downside, it requires two running OpenSearch servers temporarily,
each of which consumes resources and needs adequate disk space.
Depending on the size of your data, that may be a lot of disk space.
