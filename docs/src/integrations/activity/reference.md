  This hook allows you to capture any push events on platform and POST a JSON message describing the activity to the url of your choice. You can use this to further automate your Platform.sh workflow.

## Activity schema

### `id`

A unique opaque value to identify the activity.

### `project`

The Project ID for which the activity was triggered.
Use this value if you want to have multiple projects POST to the same URL.

### `type`

The `type` property specifies the event that happened.
Its value is one of:

* `project.modify.title`: The human-friendly title of the project has been changed.
* `project.create`: A project has been created.
  Although it will appear in the activity feed exactly once,
  it will not be sent via a webhook as it will always happen before a webhook can be configured.
* `project.domain.create`: A new domain has been added to the project.
* `project.domain.delete`: A domain associated with the project has been removed.
* `project.domain.update`: A domain associated with the project has been updated, including modifying it's SSL certificate.
* `project.variable.create`: A new project variable has been created.
* `project.variable.delete`: A project variable has been deleted.
* `project.variable.update`: A project variable has been modified.
---
* `environment.access.add`: A new user has been given access to the environment.
* `environment.access.remove`: A user has been removed from the environment.
---
* `environment_type.access.create`: A user has been given access to an environment type (Production, Staging, Development).
* `environment_type.access.delete`: A user has had their access removed from an environment type.
* `environment_type.access.update`: A user has had their access to an environment type updated.
---
* `environment.backup`: A user triggered a [backup](/administration/backup-and-restore.md).
* `environment.restore`: A user restored a [backup](/administration/backup-and-restore.md).
* `environment.backup.delete`: A user deleted a [backup](/administration/backup-and-restore.md)
---
* `environment.push`: A user has pushed code to a branch, either existing or new.
* `environment.branch`: A new branch has been created via the management console.
  (A branch created via a push will show up only as an `environment.push`.)
* `environment.activate`: A branch has been "activated", and an environment created for it.
* `environment.initialize`: The default branch of the project has just been initialized with its first commit.
* `environment.deactivate`: A branch has been "deactivated". The code is still there, but the environment was destroyed.
* `environment.synchronize`: An environment has had its data and/or code re-copied from its parent environment.
* `environment.merge`: A branch was merged through the management console or Platform.sh API.
  A basic Git merge will not trigger this event.
* `environment.redeploy`: An environment was redeployed.
* `environment.delete`: A branch was deleted.
---
* `environment.route.create`: A new route has been created through the management console.
  This will not fire for route edits made to the `routes.yaml` file directly.
* `environment.route.delete`: A route has been deleted through the management console.
  This will not fire for route edits made to the `routes.yaml` file directly.
* `environment.route.update`: A route has been modified through the management console.
  This will not fire for route edits made to the `routes.yaml` file directly.
---
* `environment.variable.create`: A new variable has been created.
* `environment.variable.delete`: A variable has been deleted.
* `environment.variable.update`: A variable has been modified.
---
* `environment.update.http_access`: HTTP access rules for an environment have been modified.
* `environment.update.smtp`: Sending of emails has been enabled/disabled for an environment.
* `environment.update.restrict_robots`: The block-all-robots feature has been enabled/disabled.
* `environment.subscription.update`: The production environment has been resized because the subscription has changed.
  There are no content changes.
---
* `environment.cron`: A cron task just completed.
* `environment.source-operation`: A source operation triggered and has completed.
---
* `environment.certificate.renewal`: An environment's SSL certificate has been renewed.
---
* `integration.bitbucket.fetch`: Changes in BitBucket repository have been pulled.
* `integration.bitbucket.register_hooks`: Integration hook have been registered on BitBucket.
* `integration.bitbucket_server.fetch`: Changes in BitBucket repository have been pulled.
* `integration.bitbucket_server.register_hooks`: Integration hook have been registered on BitBucket.
* `integration.github.fetch`: Changes in GitHub repository have been pulled.
* `integration.gitlab.fetch`: Changes in GitLab repository have been pulled.
* `integration.health.email`: Health event sent by email.
* `integration.health.pagerduty`: Health event sent to PagerDuty.
* `integration.health.slack`: Health event sent to slack.
* `integration.webhook`: Webhook triggered.
* `integration.script`: An activity script has run.

### `environments`

An array listing the environments that were involved in the activity.
This is usually single-value.

### `result`

Whether the activity was completed successfully or not.
It should be `success` if all went as planned.

### `created_at`, `started_at`, `completed_at`

These values are all timestamps in UTC.
If you need only a point in time when the action happened, use `completed_at`.
You can also combine it with `started_at` to see how long the activity took.

### `log`

A text description of the action that happened.
This is a human-friendly string that may be displayed to a user
but should not be parsed for data as its structure is not guaranteed.

### `payload.environment`

This block contains information about the environment itself, after the action has taken place.
The most notable properties of this key are

* `name` (the name of the branch)
* `machine_name` (the name of the environment)
* `head_commit` (the Git commit ID that triggered the event)

### `payload.user`

The Platform.sh user that triggered the activity.

### `deployment`

This large block details all information about all services in the environment.
That includes the resulting configuration objects derived from [`routes.yaml`](/configuration/routes/_index.md),
[`services.yaml`](/configuration/services/_index.md), and [your app configuration](../../configuration/app/_index.md).

Most notably, the `deployment.routes` object's keys are all of the URLs made available by the environment.
Note that some will be redirects.
To find those that are live URLs filter to those objects whose `type` property is `upstream`.

## Maximum activities and parallelism

Project activities are distributed across separate queues, which enables **two** simultaneous activities to occur in parallel across your environments. For a given environment, only one activity can run at a time. Those queues include:

* `default`: these include the most common activities on repositories (pushes, merges) and environments (syncs, redeployments).
* `integrations`: source and webhook integration activities.
* `backup`: backup activities.
* `cron`: cron activities.

Production activities are prioritized across all queues.
While it is still possible for a non-production environment activity to block production activities,
it is temporary and unlikely, since the moment that production activity is triggered it will jump to the top of the queue automatically.

## Example activity

The following is an example of a webhook message.
Specifically, this one was created by a "push" event.
