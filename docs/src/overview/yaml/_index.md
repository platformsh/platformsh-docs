description: An overview of YAML and its use at Platform.sh.

[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is a human-readable format for data serialization across languages.
This means it's a good fit for human-edited configuration files, like those at Platform.sh.
You can control nearly all aspects of your project's build and deploy pipeline with YAML files.

Learn what YAML is or, if you're already familiar, what custom tags Platform.sh offers.
