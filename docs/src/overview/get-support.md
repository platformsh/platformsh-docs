## Create a support ticket

To create a ticket from the console, follow these steps:

Before you begin

* You need to have a Platform.sh account.
* You must be logged into your account.

Steps

1. [Log in to Platform.sh](https://auth.api.platform.sh/)
2. In the console, click your **user profile** > **Support**.

Now you are on the **Support tickets** page.
Here you can see the list of tickets created by users in your organization over time.
If the page has no tickets, it means you're the first user in your organization creating one.

3. Click **+ New ticket**.
4. Fill in the ticket fields and click **Submit**.

Note that once you submit the ticket you won't be able to modify or delete the submission.
If you have any additional information you can add it to the ticket as a reply.
