2. Select **User menu** (your name) > **Support**.
3. Click **+ New ticket**.

In the future, you can [access the ticket list](https://console.platform.sh/-/users/~/tickets) or [open a ticket directly](https://console.platform.sh/-/users/~/tickets/open) using the shortcuts.

Once you submit a ticket, you can see it on the list alongside tickets created by users in your organization over time.
