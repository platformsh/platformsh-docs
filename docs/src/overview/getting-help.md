## Create a Customer Support ticket

To create a support ticket from the console, follow these steps:

Before you begin

* You need to have a Platform.sh account.
* You must be logged into your account.

Steps

1. Log into Platform.sh.
2. In the console, click your **user profile** > **Support**.
Now you are on the **Support tickets** page.
Here you can see the list of issues created over time by users in your organization.

If the page shows no tickets, it means you're the first user in your organization creating a ticket.

3. Click **+ New ticket**.
4. Fill in the ticket fields and click **Submit**.

Note that once you submit the ticket you won't be able to modify or delete the submission.
