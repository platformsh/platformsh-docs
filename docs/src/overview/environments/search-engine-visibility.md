When you have development environments,
you don't want search engines indexing them and diluting the SEO of your production site.

All development environments are hidden.
You can change the setting for Production environments that don't have a custom domain.

To change the environment's visibility to search engines, follow these steps:

{{< codetabs >}}

---
title=In the console
file=none
highlight=false
---

<!--This is in HTML to get the icon not to break the list. -->
<ol>
  <li>Select the project where you want to change visibility.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Environment</strong> menu, select the environment you want to change.</li>
  <li>Click {{< icon settings >}} <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the row with <strong>Hide from search engines</strong>, click <strong>Edit {{< icon chevron >}}</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select or clear the <strong>Hide from search engines</strong> checkbox.</li>
</ol>

file=none
highlight=false

Run the following command:

```bash
platform environment:info -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> restrict_robots true
```

{{< /codetabs >}}

## How it's done

Environments are hidden by including a `X-Robots-Tag` header:

```txt
X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow
```

That tells search engines to not index these sites and not traverse links from these sites.
This keeps non-production sites out of search engine indexes.

When this is off, your app can serve a `robots.txt` file from its root as normal.
Use the [`location` section of your app configuration](../../configuration/app/app-reference.md#locations).
