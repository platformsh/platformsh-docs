Security and data privacy are handled in the same way for all Dedicated projects.
For more information, see how [projects are isolated](../../dedicated-gen-3/security.md#project-isolation), 
how Platform.sh [manages incidents](../../dedicated-gen-3/security.md#security-incident-handling-procedure),
and how [data is encrypted](../../dedicated-gen-3/security.md#encryption) on your projects.
