The next step is to configure your DNS provider to point to the domain of your production environment on Platform.sh.

{{< asciinema src="videos/asciinema/cname-target.cast" >}}

You can access the CNAME target from your terminal by using the CLI and the command:

```bash
platform environment:info edge_hostname
```

Add a CNAME record from your desired domain (and it's `www` subdomain) to the value of the `edge_hostname`.
Depending on your registrar, this value may be called an "Alias" or something similar.

If your application is going to serve multiple domains, you need to add a CNAME record for each of them.

You can find out more information about using an apex domain and CNAME records
in the [Going Live documentation](/domains/steps/dns.md).

Depending on your registrar and the TTL you set for the domain,
it may take up to 72 hours for the DNS change to fully propagate across the Internet.
