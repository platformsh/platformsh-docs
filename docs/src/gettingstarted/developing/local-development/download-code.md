If you have already [pushed your code](/gettingstarted/introduction/own-code/_index.md) to Platform.sh, then you should already have a local repository that you can build from.

Otherwise, it will be necessary to download a local copy of your project first.

1. **Get project ID**

    Retrieve the **ID** of your project, using the command:  `platform`.

2. **Get a copy of the repository locally**

    Next, use the CLI to download the code in your Platform.sh project using the command:

    ```bash
    platform get <PROJECT_ID>
    ```

Next you can now connect to its services and build it on your machine.
