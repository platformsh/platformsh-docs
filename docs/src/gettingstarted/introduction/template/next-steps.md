In this guide you created a project using the [Console](/administration/web/_index.md) and installed the [Platform.sh CLI](/administration/cli/_index.md). Now you can explore some of the next steps for working with Platform.sh.

## Import your own code

Templates are great, but configuring your own application to run on Platform.sh is the goal.
