The best way to understand a tool is to use it. That's why Platform.sh offers a free one month trial.<br><br>

[Register for a trial Platform.sh account](https://auth.api.platform.sh/register).

Alternatively, you can sign up using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account. If you choose this option, you will be able to set a password for your Platform.sh account later.
