Welcome to Platform.sh! Getting started is as easy as opening a [free trial account](https://auth.api.platform.sh/register) and initializing a [template project](/development/templates.md).

There are no requirements on your part at this point. This guide will take you from zero to hero - from first glance to a deployed application entirely from your browser.
