Welcome to Platform.sh! To get started, open [free trial account](https://auth.api.platform.sh/register) and initialize a [template project](/development/templates.md).

There are no requirements on your part at this point.
This guide takes you from nothing to a full project -- from first glance to a deployed application entirely from your browser.
