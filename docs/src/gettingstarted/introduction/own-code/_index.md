Welcome to Platform.sh!
To import your own code to Platform.sh, install the CLI and configure your application with a few YAML files.

When code examples are provided in the guide, click the language of your application.  If you consult those examples and a few templates as you go along, your code will be up and running on Platform.sh in no time.
