The best way to understand a tool is to use it. That's why Platform.sh offers a free one month trial.

[Register for a trial Platform.sh account](https://auth.api.platform.sh/register).

You can sign up using an existing GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Google account.
If you choose this option, you can set a password for your Platform.sh account later.
