## 1. Install the CLI

{{% cli-installation %}}

## 2. Test the CLI

To list and manage your projects, authenticate by running the following command:

```bash
platform
```

Now that you have installed the CLI and it is communicating with Platform.sh, you can configure and push your project to Platform.sh.
