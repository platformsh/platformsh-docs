In the previous steps, you checked that the requirements on your computer were met. Now all we have to do is install the CLI and you can access your projects from the command line.

## 1. Install the CLI

{{% cli-installation %}}

## 2. Test the CLI

To interact with your projects, you need to be logged in.
To authenticate, run:

```bash
platform
```

Now that you have installed the CLI and it is communicating with Platform.sh, you can configure and push your project to Platform.sh.
