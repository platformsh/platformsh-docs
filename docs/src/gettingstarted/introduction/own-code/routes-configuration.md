The final configuration file you need to modify in your repository is the `.platform/routes.yaml` file,
which describes how an incoming HTTP request is going to be processed by Platform.sh.

```text
.
├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── .platform.app.yaml
└── < application code >
```

A minimal configuration `.platform/routes.yaml` for all languages looks very similar:

{{< readFile file="static/files/fetch/routesyaml/php" highlight="yaml" >}}

Configuring the routes can be done using either an absolute URL
or a URL template as shown in the examples above with the form `http://www.{default}`,
where `{default}` is substituted by either your configured domain or those automatically generated by Platform.sh.

If you set up a domain of `example.com`,
the route configuration `http://www.{default}` is resolved to `http://www.example.com/`.
Your production environment's routes are configured according to these rules,
but so are those for each development environment that you activate.

Each route can then be configured with the following properties:

  * `type`:
      * `upstream`: serves the application. Takes the form `upstream: <application name>:http`,
        using the application `name` set in your `.platform.app.yaml`.
      * `redirect`: configures redirects from `http://{default}` to your application.
  * `cache`: controls [caching behavior of the route](/configuration/routes/cache.md).
  * `redirects`: controls [redirect rules](/configuration/routes/redirects.md) associated with the route.

{{< note >}}

Each language and framework may have additional attributes
that you need to include in `.platform/routes.yaml` depending on the needs of your application.
To find out what else you may need to include to configure your routes, consult

* **The [Routes](/configuration/routes/_index.md) documentation for Platform.sh**

  The documentation goes into far more extensive detail of which attributes can also be included for route configuration,
  and should be used as your primary reference.

* **Language-specific templates for Platform.sh Projects:**

  Compare the `.platform/routes.yaml` file from the basic template above to other templates when writing your own.

In the next step,
you can see how Platform.sh uses environment variables to simplify the process of connecting your application to its services.
