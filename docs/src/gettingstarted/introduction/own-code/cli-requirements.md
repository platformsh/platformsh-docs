Now that you have created your free trial account, you are able to push your application to Platform.sh once you have installed the CLI.

Before you install it, there are some requirements that must be met first.

## Git

[Git](/development/tools.md#git) is the open source version control system used by Platform.sh. Any change you make to your Platform.sh project will need to be committed via Git. You can see all the Git commit messages of an environment in the `Environment Activity` feed of the [management console](/administration/web/_index.md) for each project you create.

Before getting started, make sure you [have Git installed](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer.
