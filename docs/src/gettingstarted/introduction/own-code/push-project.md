With your configuration files complete, all that's left is to commit the changes and push to Platform.sh.

{{< asciinema src="videos/asciinema/first-push.cast" >}}

1. **Commit and push**

    Run the commands

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add config files."
    git push -u platform main
    ```

    Platform.sh detects the presence of your configuration files and use them to build the application.

2. **Verify**

    When the build is completed, you can verify the deployment by typing the command

    ```bash
    platform url
    ```

    This returns a list of your routes.
    Pick the primary route `0` and press Enter, which opens your application in a browser window.

    Alternatively, you can also log back into the management console in your new project.
    Select your production environment from the `Environments` list
    and click the link in the Overview.

That's it! Using the Platform.sh CLI and a few properly configured files,
pushing your application to run on Platform.sh takes only a few minutes.

Now that your code is on Platform.sh, check out some of the Next Steps to get started developing.
