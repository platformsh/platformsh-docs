## Overview

Platform.sh provides a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution and has many customers that require us to maintain various certifications.
These certifications contain requirements to ensure certain measures are implemented to meet industry standards.
Some requirements are the responsibility of the host, some are the responsibility of the application developer,
and others are a shared responsibility.

Basic compliance questions can be handled by our support team via a ticket.
For more advanced questions, including help with an audit, please contact your Platform.sh Account Manager.


## Security & Compensating Controls

* For a list of security measures, please see our [Security page](https://platform.sh/security).
* Customer environments are deployed in a read-only instance, segregated with GRE tunnels and encrypted using TLS,
  which often permits compensating controls to be claimed for several PCI requirements.
* Because customers can use our PaaS in a variety of ways,
  the best approach with auditors is to focus on "What do I (the customer) control/configure, and how is it managed in a compliant manner?"
* The `FR-1` and `FR-3` regions are excluded from our PCI and SOC2 certifications.
* HIPAA workloads are strictly run on our US-4 region.

## Responsibility

Platform.sh and customers often have shared responsibility for ensuring an up-to-date and secure environment.
The customer is responsible for achieving and maintaining their own certifications and compliance.
