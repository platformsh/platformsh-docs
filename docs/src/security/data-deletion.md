title: Data deletion
description: |
  Data deletion is handled via our backend providers. When a volume is released back to the provider, the provider performs a wipe on the data utilizing [NIST 800-88](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-88/rev-1/final). This wipe is done immediately before reuse.

All projects, except those hosted on OVH, utilize encrypted volumes.
The encryption key is destroyed when the volume is released back to the provider,
which adds another layer of protection.

## Media destruction

Media destruction is handled via our backend providers. When the provider decommissions media, it undergoes destruction as outlined in NIST 800-88.

## Data subject removal

Data subject deletion requests where Platform.sh is the controller are handled via a [support ticket](https://docs.platform.sh/overview/getting-help.html). For contracts designating Platform.sh as the processor, deletion requests are sent to the controller, we forward any requests that we receive.

Our product is a Platform as a Service. Platform.sh doesn't directly edit customer data to ensure data confidentiality, security, and integrity. All data deletion requests for customer data must be handled by the concerned data controller.
