As part of this process, we will prepare a data breach notification with as much detail as possible, such as the nature of the data breach, possible consequences, and the measures we are taking to deal with the breach. 

If you want an email address other than the one connected to your Account to be notified of a data breach, please ensure the "Security Contact" field in your Account Settings is updated with the email address you wish to receive data breach notifications.  

Once the data breach notification is ready and approved internally, in accordance with our Data Breach Policy, we will open a Zendesk ticket against the project that was affected by the breach and send the notification. Additionally, we will send the notification to the Security Contact email address, if provided.
