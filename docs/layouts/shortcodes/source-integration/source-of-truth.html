{{ $source := .Get "source" }}
<p>When you add an integration, your {{ $source }} repository is considered to be the source of truth for the project.
Your Platform.sh project is only a mirror of that repository and you should only push commits to {{ $source }}.
Any changes you push to Platform.sh get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in your {{ $source }} repository.</p>

<p>To clone your code, follow these steps:</p>

{{ $Inner := `

Run the following command:

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">platform get {{< variable PROJECT_ID >}}</code></pre></div>

<p>When you do this, you're cloning from your integrated {{ $source }} repository,
if you have the <a href="/integrations/source/troubleshoot.html">appropriate access to do so</a>.</p>
