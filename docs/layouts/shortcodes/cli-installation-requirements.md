Before you install it, there are some requirements that must be met first.

You need to have:

* [PHP 5.5.9+](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) with the following extensions installed: `curl`, `json`, `mbstring`, `pcre`, and `phar`.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is the open source version control system used to manage your project. Any change you make to your codebase needs to be committed via Git. You can see all the Git commit messages of an environment in the `Environment Activity` feed of the [Console](/administration/web/_index.md) for each project you create.
* A Bash-like shell.

On Windows, the best way to get Bash is through [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/about).
