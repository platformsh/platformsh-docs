Platform.sh automatically provides standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for all sites and environments.
These certificates are issued at no charge by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
In most cases, this is sufficient and only requires you to [specify HTTPS routes](/define-routes/https.md#using-https). 
Note that some [limits](/define-routes/https.md#limits) apply.
