<p>Platform.sh provides all information about the running environment, including how to connect to services, through <a href="{{ relref . "/development/variables/_index.md" }}">environment variables</a>. It is not required as these values can be accessed directly, but it is often easier to use the <a href="https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs">Config Reader</a> library that Platform.sh provides.</p>
