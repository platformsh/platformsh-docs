<p>The end goal of this guide is to deploy your {{ .Get "name" }} application to a <em>project</em> on Platform.sh. In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository. A project replicates the branching structure of a repository exactly, but with one important addition: any branch can be <em>activated</em> to become an <em>environment</em> on Platform.sh. Activated environments go through Platform.sh's build and deploy phases, resulting in a fully isolated running site for each activated branch (or pull request) on that repo.</p>

<p>Once an environment is activated, Platform.sh will provision a cluster of containers to deploy your application, and the configuration of that cluster is controlled by three <a href="{{ relref . "/configuration/yaml.md" }}">YAML files</a>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>.platform/routes.yaml</code> controls how incoming requests are routed to your application, or applications if running a multi-app setup.  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.</li>
    <li><code>.platform/services.yaml</code> controls what additional services are created to support your application, such as databases or search servers.  Every environment has its own independent copy of every service.</li>
    <li><code>.platform.app.yaml</code> controls the configuration of the container where your application lives.  It is the most powerful with the most options, and therefore can also get somewhat long depending on your configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project on Platform.sh needs at least these three files, and each can be customized however you need.  However, most {{ .Get "name" }} sites will have a fairly similar configuration, at least to start.  More details of each are available below.</p>

<p>You can start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c1"># Create empty Platform.sh configuration files</span>
$ touch .platform.app.yaml && mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/routes.yaml && touch .platform/services.yaml</code></pre>
</div>

{{ if isset .Params "platformify" }}
<p>You can also rely on the platformify script to initialize those files. Only the missing files will be downloaded locally from the official template. The pre-existing ones will be left untouched.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c1"># Platformify your application and automatically download the missing configuration files</span>
$ sh <( curl -s 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/snippets/main/src/platformify.sh' ) -t {{ .Get "platformify" }}</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When ran on an empty folder, the whole template can be downloaded locally.</p>
{{ end }}


<p>Now that you've added these files to your project, you can go through and configure each of them for {{ .Get "name" }} one by one in the sections below. Each section covers a particular configuration file, defines what each attribute configures, and then shows a final code snippet that includes the recommended configuration for {{ .Get "name" }} pulled from its template. Within that snippet, be sure to read each of the comments as they provide additional information and reasoning for why {{ .Get "name" }} requires those values.</p>
