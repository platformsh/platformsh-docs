{{ $name := .Get "name" }}
<p>The end goal of this guide is to deploy your {{ $name }} application to a <em>project</em> on Platform.sh. In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository. A project replicates the branching structure of a repository exactly, but with one important addition: any branch can be <em>activated</em> to become an <em>environment</em> on Platform.sh. Activated environments go through Platform.sh's build and deploy phases, resulting in a fully isolated running site for each activated branch (or pull request) on that repo.</p>

<p>Once an environment is activated, Platform.sh will provision a cluster of containers to deploy your application, and the configuration of that cluster is controlled by three <a href="{{ relref . "/configuration/yaml.md" }}">YAML files</a>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>.platform/routes.yaml</code> controls how incoming requests are routed to your application, or applications if running a multi-app setup. It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.</li>
    <li><code>.platform/services.yaml</code> controls what additional services are created to support your application, such as databases or search servers. Each environment has its own independent copy of each service. If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.</li>
    <li><code>.platform.app.yaml</code> controls the configuration of the container where your application lives. It's the most powerful configuration file with the most options. So it can get somewhat long depending on your configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project on Platform.sh needs at least two of these files and each file can be customized however you need. But most {{ $name }} sites will have a fairly similar configuration, at least to start.</p>

<p>You can start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c1"># Create empty Platform.sh configuration files</span>
$ touch .platform.app.yaml && mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/routes.yaml {{ if not (.Get "noService") }}&& touch .platform/services.yaml{{end}}</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now that you've added these files to your project, you can go through and configure each of them for {{ $name }} one by one in the sections below. Each section covers a particular configuration file, defines what each attribute configures, and then shows a final code snippet that includes the recommended configuration for {{ $name }} pulled from its template. Within that snippet, be sure to read each of the comments as they provide additional information and reasoning for why {{ $name }} requires those values.</p>
