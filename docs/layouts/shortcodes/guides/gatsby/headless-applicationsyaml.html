<p>You can optionally combine the application configuration (<code>.platform.app.yaml</code>) for Gatsby and {{ .Get "name" }} into a single configuration file called <a href="/create-apps/multi-app.html#applicationsyaml"><code>applications.yaml</code></a>. Like <code>services.yaml</code> and <code>routes.yaml</code>, this file is shared across the project and resides in the <code>.platform</code> subdirectory. It does require that you explicitly define the <a href="/create-apps/multi-app.html#explicit-sourceroot">source of each application</a>, so <a href="/create-apps/multi-app.html">consult the documentation</a> for more information.</p>
