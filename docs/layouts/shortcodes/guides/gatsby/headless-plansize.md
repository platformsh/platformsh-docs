As mentioned previously, you should have at least a Medium plan for your multi-app projects.
This size gives the project enough resources for all of your containers
as well as the memory necessary to actually pull content from the Drupal container into Gatsby during its build.

Keep in mind that the increased plan size applies only to your Production environment,
and not to development environments (which default to "Standard").
As you continue to work with Gatsby and a backend headless CMS,
you may want to [upsize your development environments](/overview/pricing.html#development)
