<p>In your local clone of the template, you will notice the following project structure:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">.
├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── {{ anchorize (.Get "name" )}}
│   ├── &lt;application code&gt;

└── README.md</code></pre></div>

<p>In this repository, you will deploy a Gatsby app and a {{ .Get "name" }} app, and the code for each of them resides in their own subdirectories. When deploying a single application project to Platform.sh <a href="/guides/gatsby/deploy.html">Gatsby, for example</a>, that repository needs to have three configuration files commmitted that describe its infrastructure, which are described below in detail. For <a href="/create-apps/multi-app.html">multi-app projects</a>, however, two of those files remain in the project root and are shared between Gatsby and {{ .Get "name" }}, while each application keeps its own application configuration file (<code>.platform.app.yaml</code>) in its subdirectory.</p>
