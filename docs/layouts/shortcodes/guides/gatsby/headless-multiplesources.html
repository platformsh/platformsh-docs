<p>Gatsby supports pulling multiple sources into its build. This can include external services like Stripe, or additional backend CMSs for different sets of content. Like shown here with {{ .Get "name" }}, you can branch off your repository and add an additional subdirectory that contains the codebase for <a href="/guides/gatsby/headless.html#headless-backends">another backend</a>, and then add the source plugin for that backend to <code>gatsby-config.js</code>.</p>
