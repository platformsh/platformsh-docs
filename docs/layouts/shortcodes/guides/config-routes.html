<p>The <code>routes.yaml</code> file controls the <a href="{{ relref . "/define-routes/_index.md" }}">routing</a> and caching of all HTTP requests sent to your application cluster.  Typically you will just route all incoming requests to your one application container, where your site lives, but many more elaborate configurations are possible.</p>

<p>The two most important parts to configure are the main route itself and its caching rules.  A route can have a placeholder of <code>{default}</code>, which will be replaced with a branch-specific generated domain name or, in production, with your configured domain name.</p>

<p>The route then has an <code>upstream</code>, which is the name of the container that it should forward requests to.  99% of the time you want the <code>name</code> property in the <code>.platform.app.yaml</code> file.</p>

<p>You can (and should) enable the <a href="{{ relref . "/define-routes/cache.md" }}">HTTP cache</a>.  The router includes a basic HTTP cache that will obey the HTTP cache headers produced by your application.  However, by default HTTP caches will include all cookies in the cache key, which if you have any cookies at all makes the site uncacheable. Instead, the <code>cookies</code> key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache; generally that will be just the user session cookie, which for {{ .Get "name" }} is included below.  However, depending on what additional modules you have installed there may be other cookies you need to add.</p>

<p>Finally, routes can also be <a href="{{ relref . "/define-routes/redirects.md" }}">HTTP redirects</a>, either fully or partially.  In this example, all <code>www.{default}</code> requests will be redirected to the equivalent non-www URL.  You could also configure it the other way around if desired.  More complex redirects are also possible.</p>

<p>Don't worry about unencrypted HTTP routes. All requests on Platform.sh are TLS-enabled, and we automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.</p>
