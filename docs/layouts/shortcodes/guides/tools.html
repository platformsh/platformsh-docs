<p>Next, youâ€™re going to need a couple tools to be able to interact with your Platform.sh project, two of which you likely already have.</p>

<p>The first is <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, which you need to have installed before moving forward. As a Platform as a Service (PaaS), Platform.sh automatically manages everything your application needs in order to run. Git is the primary tool used to do this. Every commit pushed results in a new deployment, and all of your configuration is driven almost entirely by a small number of YAML files in your Git repository (which we will get to in the steps below). Your infrastructure, described in these files, becomes part of your application itself - completely transparent and version-controlled. If you do not already have Git on your computer, you should <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/">install it now</a>.</p>

<p>Second, in this guide you interact with your Platform.sh project from both your browser and the command line using the <a href="{{ relref . "/development/cli/_index.md" }}">Platform.sh CLI</a>. Both utilize our API so that you can make changes to your projects, but the CLI will be the tool you use the most in this guide. Below are a set of installation commands for different operating systems:</p>

<!-- CLI install commands -->
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c1"># Linux/macOS</span>
$ curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer <span class="p">|</span> php
    
<span class="c1"># Windows</span>
$ curl https://platform.sh/cli/installer -o cli-installer.php
$ php cli-installer.php</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once the installation has completed, you can run the CLI in your terminal with the command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c1"># Verify the installation</span>
$ platform</code></pre></div>

<p>On the first run, you need to log in using a browser.</p>

<p>Take a moment to view some of the available commands with the command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c1"># View the list of CLI commands</span>
$ platform list</code></pre></div>
