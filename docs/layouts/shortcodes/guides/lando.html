<p><a href="https://github.com/lando/lando" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando</a> is Platform.sh&rsquo;s recommended local development tool. Lando can read your Platform.sh configuration files for Wordpress and produce an approximately equivalent configuration using Docker with minimal effort. See the <a href="https://docs.lando.dev/config/platformsh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando documentation</a> for installing and setting up Lando on your system.</p>
<p>Templates come configured for use already with a base <a href="https://docs.lando.dev/config/lando.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landofile</a> shown below, which can be helpful getting started with Lando without the need to have a project on Platform.sh. This file sets up good defaults for Lando and Platform.sh-configured codebases, most notably through the <code>recipe</code> attribute.</p>

{{ $file := printf "static/files/fetch/lando/%s" (.Get "repo" ) }}
{{ highlight ( readFile $file ) "yaml" ""}}

<p>This Landofile is also the place where you can configure access to tools that would normally be available within a Platform.sh app container (such as the WordPress CLI), that you would also want access to locally.</p>

<p>You can replicate this file, or otherwise follow the directions in the <a href="https://docs.lando.dev/config/platformsh.html#getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando documentation for Platform.sh</a> to setup the repository locally.  Once you have completed the configuration, you can then start to local environment by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ lando start
</code></pre></div>
