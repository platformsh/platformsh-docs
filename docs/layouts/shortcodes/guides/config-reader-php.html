<p>Platform.sh provides all information about the running environment, including how to connect to services, through <a href="{{ relref . "/development/variables/_index.md" }}">environment variables</a>.  These may be accessed directly, but it is often easier to use the <a href="https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-php">Config Reader</a> library that Platform.sh provides.  The Config Reader is simply a set of utilities to wrap the environment variables and make them a bit more ergonomic to work with.  The code below makes use of it, so you'll need to install it through Composer if it isn't already.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ composer require platformsh/config-reader
</code></pre>
