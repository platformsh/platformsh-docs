<p>Depending on whether or not you have an existing project you want to migrate to Platform.sh there are three ways to get started.</p>

<h3>With a template</h3>

<p>First, you can deploy a {{ .Get "name" }} template itself straight to Platform.sh.  Use the button below to launch a {{ .Get "name" }} template project, and you will create a Platform.sh account along the way. If you don't want to sign up initially with your e-mail address, you can sign up using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account. If you choose one of these options, you will be able to set a password for your Platform.sh account later.</p>

<p>Once the template is deployed, you can then follow along with the rest of this guide so you can better understand the extra files and tweaks in the repository.</p>

  </a>
</p>

<h3>With a brand new code base</h3>

<p>If you want to start with a vanilla code base, or you have a pre-existing project you want to push to Platform.sh, that works, too.</p>

<p>You will first need to <a href="https://auth.api.platform.sh/register">register for a trial Platform.sh account</a>. If you don't want to sign up initially with your e-mail address, you can sign up using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account. If you choose one of these options, you will be able to set a password for your Platform.sh account later.</p>

<p>After creating an account, you will be prompted to create your first project.  Since you'll be providing your own code, use the "Blank project" option.  You will be able to give the project a title and choose a region closest to the visitors of your site. You also have the option to select more resources for your project, although the <code>development</code> plan should be enough for you to get started.</p>

<p>Then, add a Git remote for the Platform.sh project you just created.  The easiest way to get the ID of the project is to run just <code>plaform</code> on its own, which lists all of your projects.  As you have only one project, you can copy its ID.  Then in your Git repository run</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ platform set-remote &lt;PROJECT_ID>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That creates an upstream called <code>platform</code> for your Git repository.  Don't push to it yet, but once the project is fully configured you will be able to push to that remote and have the project build automatically.</p>

<h3>From a third party Git provider</h3>

<p>Platform.sh also supports third party Git hosting services, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.  In that case, the Platform.sh Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third party repository, which you can continue to use as normal.</p>

<p>You will first need to <a href="https://auth.api.platform.sh/register">register for a trial Platform.sh account</a>. If you don't want to sign up initially with your e-mail address, you can sign up using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account. If you choose one of these options, you will be able to set a password for your Platform.sh account later.</p>

<p>After creating an account, you will be prompted to create your first project.  Since you'll be providing your own code, use the "Blank project" option.  You will be able to give the project a title and choose a region closest to the visitors of your site. You also have the option to select more resources for your project, although the <code>development</code> plan should be enough for you to get started.</p>

<p>Then, add an integration on Platform.sh to connect the new project to your existing third party repository.  The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/integrations/source/bitbucket.html">BitBucket</a></li>
  <li><a href="/integrations/source/github.html">GitHub</a></li>
  <li><a href="/integrations/source/gitlab.html">GitLab</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They have a number of options, all of which you can ignore for now - the defaults will suffice at this point.  Once you add the integration, any existing branches you have will automatically be synchronized to Platform.sh.  The deploy on Platform.sh will report a failure at this point; that's OK, you haven't provided configuration files yet.  That will be covered in the next step.  Remember to have a local clone of your project as well.</p>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert"><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p class="alert-text"><p>If you are integrating a repository to Platform.sh that contains a number of open pull requests, the default integration options should not be used. This is because projects are limited to *three development environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests), and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide's migration changes. Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:</p>
  <div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ platform integration:add --type<span class="o">=</span>&lt;service&gt; ... --build-pull-requests<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">false</span></code></pre></div>
  <p>You will then be able to go through this guide and activate the environment when you're ready to deploy.</p>
  <p>*Note that it is also possible to purchase additional development environments for your project at any time through the <a href="https://console.platform.sh">management console</a>. View your list of projects and select "Edit plan" from the dropdown of your {{ .Get "name" }} project. From there you can add additional environments on the "Environments" line and get a price estimate for the changes to your plan.</p>
  </p>
  </div>

<p>Now that you have a local Git repository, a Platform.sh project, and a way to push code to that project, you're all set to continue.</p>
