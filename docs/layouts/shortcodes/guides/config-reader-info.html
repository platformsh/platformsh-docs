<p>Platform.sh provides all information about the running environment, including how to connect to services, through <a href="{{ relref . "/development/variables.md" }}">environment variables</a>.  These may be accessed directly, but it is often easier to use the <a href="https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-{{ .Get "lang" }}">Config Reader</a> library that Platform.sh provides.  The Config Reader is simply a set of utilities to wrap the environment variables and make them a bit more ergonomic to work with.</p>
