What is Platform.sh?
====================

Platform.sh is a groundbreaking hosting and development tool for web applications. It extends a branch-merge workflow to infrastructure so that every branch can be tested as if it were in production, and scales for the largest sites.

How does it work?
-----------------

Platform.sh operates on the idea that you as a web developer will manage your application code in Git. From there, Platform.sh can provision each Git branch with a full application stack to run your application, online, with a synchronized copy of the applications data (DB, uploaded files, Solr index, etc.) 

This means that you now can work with your application infrastructure the same way you work with Git: branching and merging is cheap and fast, and you are no longer responsible for Sysadmin or DevOps tasks that distract you from coding.

How is it different?
--------------------

Platform.sh is **built around a Continuous Integration model**, so features and fixes can be integrated quickly and easily, rather than forcing delays waiting for scheduled batch deployments. That means less waiting for code changes to go live, whether they be tiny tweaks or brand new functionality.
