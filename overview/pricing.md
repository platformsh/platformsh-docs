> In this section we describe the billing in US Dollars, you will be build in 
> Dollars, Euros or British Pounds depending on where your billing address is.

> include the correct VAT rate.

## Extras

All extra consumption is prorated to the time it was actually used. 

> So if for example you added an extra developer for 10 days you would be billed around  extra $3 at the end of the month.

### Extra developers

Adding a developer to your project will add $10 per month.

### Extra environments

You can add extra development staging/development to any plan by multiples of 3
for $21 / month. 

> So if for example you want to have 12 staging servers you would pay additional $63 per month on top of your basic plan price.

### Extra storage

You can add additional storage at $2.50 per 5GB  per staging/development 
environment. 

>So if you have the default plan (with 3 staging environments) and you add 10GB (so total 15GB per environment) you would pay an extra $15 a month.

>If you added 3 extra environments (for a total of 6 staging environments) and you added 10GB (so total 15GB) you would pay an extra $30 a month.

## Development

The basic Plan (development) starts at 10$ per month (including 4 environments : 3 staging/development and 1 future production).

> You can not map a custom domain name to a development plan

## Production - Standard / Medium / Large

The live environment (master) of a production plan has more resources
then the development environments.
You can map domain names to your master environment, SSL support is included.

Production plans come in three flavors:

* Standard: with 2GB of dedicated memory
* Medium: with 4GB of dedicated memory
* Large: with 7GB of dedicated memory

### Multiple Applications in a single cluster
All Platform.sh plans support multiple applications in a single cluster but
they all share the global resource of the cluster.

The resources of a **Standard plan are not sufficient to run more then one 
application** in the same cluster if there is also a MySQL database as a service. So useful multi-apps start at Medium.

A Medium plan for example can support 3 Apps with a MySql Instance and a Redis 
instance.

If you wonder if a specific setup would fit in a plan, don't hesitate to
contact our support.

## Enterprise

Enterprise plans start at $670 a month. 

So for a price lower than traditional managed hosting, you get included 
development and staging environments and triple redundancy on every element of 
the stack.
