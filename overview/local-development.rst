Local Development
=================


In addition to your environments on Platform.sh, you also have one more - your local development environment. You connect your local environment to to Platform.sh. 

If you are a web developer, chances are you are already running a local hosting environment on your workstation. You edit the code and configure the database, your application engine obeys your commands and your web server hands over the resources. 

One big benefit is the ability to work offline - you don’t need to be connected to the Internet to get stuff done. You can work on the train and push your changes to Platform.sh later. 

When you are online, you can download an environment to your workstation, do your work and, when ready, upload to Platform.sh.
