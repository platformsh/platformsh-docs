#Getting a complete local setup
We have created a new site.. and a staging server.. but we did not run our
installation locally. For this we will need two things:

* Create the local configuration (settings.php)  our local Drupal instance will use
* Have the infrastructure needed (minimally a web server and a database)

Remember the `shared` directory that the Platform CLI built? this is where
we will put the local configuration.
