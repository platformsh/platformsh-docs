# Understand Settings.php

Drupal sites use a file called settings.php to store database connection
details and other important configurations. Platform.sh has a specific
concept for managing settings.php which is important to understand to
succeed. For both the local copy of your site, as well as on the server,
settings.php should be found at sites/default/settings.php, and should
be generated by Platform.sh. That means you will not be committing a
settings.php file to your Git repository in normal circumstances. Here
is the entire contents of a generated settings.php:

```php
<?php

$update_free_access = FALSE;

$drupal_hash_salt = 'do-not-copy-and-paste-this-is-something-you-need-to-change';

$local_settings = dirname(__FILE__) . '/settings.local.php';
if (file_exists($local_settings)) {
  require $local_settings;
}
```

The important part to see, starting in line 6, is the inclusion of
another file, `settings.local.php`, which will handle the actual
connection to the database, as well as the parsing of other important
environmental variables from Platform.sh.
