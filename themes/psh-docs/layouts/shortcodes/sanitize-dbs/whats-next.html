You learned how to remove sensitive data from a database.

To replace sensitive data that with other meaningful data, you can add a `faker` to the process.
A `faker` is a program that generates fake data that looks real.
Having meaningful PII-free data allows you to keep your current Q&A, external reviews, and other processes.
To add a faker, adapt your sanitizing queries to replace each value that contains PII with a new value generated by the faker.

You might also want to make sure that you [implement input validation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html#goals-of-input-validation).
