**Before adding routes to your {{ .Site.Params.vendor.name }} project, you must configure your DNS records** so that each route’s hostname resolves to the project’s assigned target (for example, via CNAME or appropriate DNS records).
If DNS doesn’t point to your project, certificate renewal will fail.
