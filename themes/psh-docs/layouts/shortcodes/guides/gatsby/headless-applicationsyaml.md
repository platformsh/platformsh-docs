You can optionally combine the application configuration (`.platform.app.yaml`) for Gatsby
and {{ .Get "name" }} into a [single configuration file](/create-apps/multi-app/project-structure.md#unified-app-configuration).
Like `services.yaml` and `routes.yaml`, this file is shared across the project and resides in the `.platform` subdirectory.
You need to explicitly define the source of each application.
