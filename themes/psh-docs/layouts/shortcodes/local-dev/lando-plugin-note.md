Lando used to support Platform.sh PHP projects out of the box through a plugin.
However, this plugin is now deprecated.
It's still available, but it's no longer receiving updates and isn't guaranteed to work.

For a seamless experience, switch to [DDEV](./ddev.md), which is the recommended tool for local development with Platform.sh.
The integration with DDEV is maintained by Platform.sh to ensure it works smoothly.
Note that a Platform.sh migration guide from Lando to DDEV will be released soon.
