# Onboarding process

On-Boarding a new Enterprise client is a three phase process that begins the moment your contract is closed with your sales representative.  As part of the onboarding service, you will continue to work with Solutions Engineer who was present during the technical discovery and analysis during the pre-sales phase.  During the entire on-boarding process, your Solutions Engineer is available to assist with questions and prioritize any tickets that may be submitted through the help desk.
