# Backup and restore

Backups vary by our offering and their retention is governed by our [data retention](/security/data-retention.md) policies.

Below are details on our Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for our Platform Standard and Platform Enterprise offerings.

## Platform Standard

With Platform Standard, we have enabled our clients to manage their own backup and restore functions. Please see the [snapshot and restore](/administration/snapshot-and-restore.md) page for details.

**RPO**: User defined. The RPO is configured by our clients.

**RTO**: Variable. Recovery time will depend upon the size of the data we are recovering

## Platform Enterprise

**RPO**: 6 hours.  Platform.sh takes a backup of Platform.sh Enterprise environments every 6 hours.

**RTO**: Variable. Recovery time will depend upon the size of the data we are recovering
