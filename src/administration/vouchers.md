# Vouchers 

## Applying a voucher to your project

If you receive a [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/) voucher you can redeem it as follows:

* Go to your account settings via the UI link in the top-right corner of the screen (where your profile picture is) or using this link: [https://accounts.platform.sh/user](https://accounts.platform.sh/user).
* In the left navigation click on vouchers (the seventh entry)
* On the page click on "add a voucher code"
* Enter the code and click on the "ADD CODE" button
* Et voila! Your account will now be credited with additional dollar, pounds or euros. 

If you are assessing Platform.sh for your organziation and need think that you could benefit from a little more oomf in your test project why not contact us to request a voucher? Write to: sales@platform.sh.
