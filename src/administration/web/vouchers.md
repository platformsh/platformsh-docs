# Vouchers

## Applying a voucher to your project

If you receive a Platform.sh voucher code, you can redeem it as follows:

- Go to your Account Settings, logging in if necessary, via the link in the top-right corner of these docs, or via this link: [https://accounts.platform.sh/user](https://accounts.platform.sh/user).
- In the left navigation click on "VOUCHERS"
- On the page click on "Add a voucher code"
- Enter the code and click on the "ADD CODE" button
- Et voilà! Your account will now be credited with additional dollars pounds or euros.

If you are assessing Platform.sh for your organization and think that you could benefit from a little more _oomf_ in your test project why not contact us to request a voucher? You can tell us more at: [https://platform.sh/contact/](https://platform.sh/contact/)
