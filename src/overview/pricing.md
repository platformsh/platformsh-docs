> Prices below are listed in US Dollars.  You will be billed in US Dollars, Euros, or British Pounds depending on where your billing address is. For a list of current prices please refer to https://platform.sh/pricing

> Euro Prices are presented excluding VAT.  In your bill, as appropriate we will include the correct VAT rate.

## Extras

All extra consumption is prorated to the time it was actually used.

> For example, if you added an extra developer for 10 days you would be billed around $3 extra at the end of the month (based on the then-current price of an extra developer seat).

### Extra developers

Adding a developer to your project will add a monthly per project per user fee unless you have an agency or an enterprise account. 

### Extra environments

You can add extra staging/development environments to any plan by multiples of 3.

> For example, if you want to have 12 staging environments you would pay additional $63 per month on top of your basic plan price.

### Extra storage

You can add additional storage at $2.50 per 5GB  per staging/development environment.

>For example, if you have the default plan (with 3 staging environments) and you add 10GB (for a total of 15GB per environment), you would pay an extra $15 a month.

>If you added 3 extra environments (for a total of 6 staging environments) and you added 10GB (for a total of 15GB per environment), you would pay an extra $30 a month.

## Development

The basic plan (Development) starts at $10 per month, and includes 4 environments: 3 staging/development and 1 future production).

> You can not map a custom domain name to a development plan

Development environments have less resources than production environments.

## Production

The live environment (master) of a production plan has more resources than the development environments of the project. https://platform.sh/pricing lists the resources available per plan (these are always only the production environment resources) the development environment have their own resources, and are not counted towards the limit.
You can map domain names to your master environment. SSL support is always included. 


### Multiple Applications in a single project

All Platform.sh plans support multiple applications in a single cluster, but they share the global resources of the cluster.

The resources of a **Standard plan are not sufficient to run more than one application** in the same cluster if there is also a MySQL database as a Service. Useful multi-apps start at Medium.

A Medium plan, for example, can support 3 Apps with a MySQL instance and a Redis instance.

## Sovereign German Cloud


The prices for Germany are currently set at 30% above the EU and US plan prices. Thus, a "Production Standard" environment on the Sovereign German Cloud will be $65 instead of $50.

Our estimation page (which you can reach by clicking on your account dashboard on the edit link for a project) does reflect these new options.
