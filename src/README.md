This documentation will aid you in making your site sing with Platform.sh.  If you're new to Platform.sh, we recommend starting with the **Big Picture**, in particular [How we think](/overview/how-we-think.md), [How it looks](/overview/how-itlooks.md), and [How it works](/overview/how-it works.md) will get you started on the right track to best leverage Platform.sh.

You're project's configuration is driven almost entirely by a small number of YAML files.  The **Configuration** section covers those in more detail and can serve as both tutorial and quick-reference.
