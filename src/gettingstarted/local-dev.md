# Local Development

![Local development](/images/pretty/home-clone.png)

Now that you have a project on Platform.sh, it would be helpful to run the same build process on your local machine so that you can develop and test new features before pushing them. This guide will take you through the steps of connecting remotely to your services and building your application locally.

These steps assume that you have already:

* Signed up for a [free trial account](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup) with Platform.sh.
* Started either a [template project](/gettingstarted/template.md) or [pushed your own code](/gettingstarted/own-code.md) to Platform.sh.

If you have not completed these steps by now, click the links and do so before you begin.
