In this guide you created a project using the [CLI](/development/cli.md) and configured your project to run on Platform.sh using a few simple configuration files.

Don't stop now! There are far more features that make Platform.sh profoundly helpful to developers that you have left to explore.

### Developing on Platform.sh

Once an application has been migrated to Platform.sh, there's plenty more features that will help improve your development life cycle.

    var descTitle = "Local Development";
    var descDesc = "Remotely connect to services and build your application locally during development.";
    var descPath = getPathObj("/gettingstarted/local-development.html", descTitle, descDesc);
    var descButton = {type: "descriptive", path: descPath, div: "local-dev"};
    makeButton(descButton);
</script>
