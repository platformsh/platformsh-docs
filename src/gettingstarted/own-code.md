# Import your own code

Welcome to Platform.sh! Importing your own code to Platform.sh is as easy as installing the CLI and configuring your application with a few yaml files. 

When code examples are provided in the guide, click the language of your application.  If you consult those examples and a few templates as you go along, your code will be up and running on Platform.sh in no time. 

<div id = "buttons"></div>

<script>
    var navNextText = "Get started!";
    var navButtons = {type: "navigation", next: getPathObj("next", navNextText), div: "buttons"};
    makeButton(navButtons);
</script>
