# Development Environments

While you're developing your application, you will at some point create some new features for it. Typically you're going to develop that feature on a separate branch in your Git repository, run some tests, and then merge that feature into your production application.

This is where the stress comes in and where breaking your live site becomes a real worry.

Platform.sh removes this stress considerably by providing *live development environments* for the features you're working on.

This guide assumes that you have already:

* Signed up for a [free trial account](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup) with Platform.sh.
* Started either a [template project](/gettingstarted/template.md) or [pushed your own code](/gettingstarted/own-code.md) to Platform.sh.

If you have not completed these steps by now, click the links and do so before you begin.

<div class="buttons">
  <a class="button-link single" onclick="gitbook.navigation.goNext()">Get started!</a>
</div>
