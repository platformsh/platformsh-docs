Welcome to Platform.sh! Importing your own code to Platform.sh is as easy as installing the CLI and configuring your application with a few YAML files.

When code examples are provided in the guide, click the language of your application.  If you consult those examples and a few templates as you go along, your code will be up and running on Platform.sh in no time.
