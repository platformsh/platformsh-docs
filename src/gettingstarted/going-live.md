# Going Live

You've set up a project on Platform.sh by either [pushing your code](/gettingstarted/own-code.md) directly or by [setting up an integration](/gettingstarted/integrations.md) to an external repository. Now it's time to take your site live.

This guide will take you through the process configuring your project for production, setting up a domain, and configuring DNS so that your users can reach the application the way you want them to.

<div id = "buttons"></div>

<script>
    var templatePath = getPathObj("/gettingstarted/going-live/first-steps.html", "Take your site live!");
    var templates = {type: "basic", path: templatePath, div: "buttons"};
    makeButton(templates)
</script>
