# Going live

You've set up a project on Platform.sh by either [pushing your code](/gettingstarted/own-code.md) directly or by [setting up an integration](/gettingstarted/integrations.md) to an external repository. Now it's time to take your site live.

This guide will take you through the process configuring your project for production, setting up a domain, and configuring DNS so that your users can reach the application the way you want them to.
