---

Full access to [Blackfire](https://www.blackfire.io/) is bundled with all your PHP and
Python {{< vendor/name >}} projects.

Blackfire is the **official {{< vendor/name >}} observability service** that helps you
improve the performance of your apps at each stage of their lifecycle.
With Blackfire's unique Application Performance Monitoring (APM), Profiling,
Alerting, and Testing features, you can achieve the following goals:

- Avoid performance bottlenecks by proactively identifying issues in your code
- Promptly solve identified issues by taking advantage of actionable recommendations
- Create performance budgets for critical parts of your app and get alerted of any
  problem before a change hits your production

Blackfire is installed natively on {{< vendor/name >}} and [works integrally with the {{< vendor/name >}} workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq-LFjgD6L0).
This results in an effortless setup process and smooth user experience.

## Get started with Blackfire

You can only access your Blackfire environments after you've been granted access to the related {{< vendor/name >}} project.
Therefore, to access your Blackfire environments, make sure you log in using your {{< vendor/name >}} account.

To access a Blackfire environment, each project user needs a Blackfire account.
When a project user doesn't already have a Blackfire account,
a new one is automatically created using the user's {{< vendor/name >}} credentials.

{{< note >}}
If you're using a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](../../domains/cdn/_index.md),
make sure you [configure it](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/proxies/index)
to let Blackfire profile the code running on your servers.

### Automated integration

The Blackfire automated integration is enabled on your environments by default.

When you create a new environment,
it automatically triggers the creation of a Blackfire environment with the same settings.
On this Blackfire environment, you have access to [all the features provided by Blackfire](https://www.blackfire.io/features/).
This includes monitoring, profiling, alerting, and build-related features.

Note that Blackfire monitoring is enabled by default on your production environment.
On other environment types, you need to [enable it](#blackfire-monitoring).
User access settings are replicated from the {{< vendor/name >}} Console to Blackfire -- this includes all [access levels](https://blackfire.io/docs/up-and-running/access-management).
 
You might have Blackfire variables already set on your project.
In this case, the existing variables override the settings of the automated integration.

{{< note >}}
To trigger the synchronization of changes to users and their access levels,
you need to redeploy the environment.

### Blackfire monitoring

Blackfire monitoring is enabled by default on your production environment.
To enable Blackfire monitoring on your development or staging environments, follow these steps:

1.  Go to your [organizations list](https://blackfire.io/my/organizations)
    and select the organization where you want to enable Blackfire monitoring.

2.  Click **Organization Monitoring Usage**.

    ![A screenshot of where to find Organization Monitoring Usage](/images/integrations/blackfire/blackfire-organization-monitoring.png "0.40")

3.  In the **Monitoring Activation** section,
    enable monitoring on the environments of your choice.

For more information on Blackfire monitoring features,
see the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/monitoring-cookbooks/index).

## Blackfire Profiling

While your code is running, the Blackfire profiler collects deep performance metrics
and provides full details and context of your code's behavior.
This helps you find the root cause of performance bottlenecks.

Blackfire lets you profile your application anywhere it's deployed,
including on your local development machines.
Using a browser extension or CLI command,
you can profile HTTP requests, CLI scripts, Consumers, and Daemons.

While HTTP requests can be profiled out-of-the-box, CLI profiling requires a
[specific configuration](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/paas/upsun#cli-profiling).

For more information on Blackfire profiling features,
see the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/profiling-cookbooks/index).

## Test the performance of each new deployment

Blackfire's native integration with {{< vendor/name >}} enables you to test your app's performance
every time you deploy a branch in production, staging, or development.
Follow these steps:

1.  Set up the [Blackfire Builds integration](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/paas/upsun#builds).

2.  Optional: set up an [integration with your Git provider](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/git/index)
    and get commit status updates from build reports.

3.  Recommended: test business-critical use cases, with Blackfire [synthetic monitoring](https://blackfire.io/docs/builds-cookbooks/scenarios).

## Troubleshooting

### Bypass your reverse proxy, load balancer or CDN

To use [Blackfire profiling](#blackfire-profiling), you need to bypass any reverse
proxy, load balancer or [CDN](../../domains/cdn/_index.md) that sits in front of your app.

See [how to configure a bypass](https://blackfire.io/docs/reference-guide/reverse-proxies#documentation).

### Configure your HTTP cache

To take advantage of Blackfire features while using the HTTP cache with cookies,
allow the `__blackfire` cookie to go through the cache.

To do so, add [a configuration](../../define-routes/cache.md#allowing-only-specific-cookies)
similar to the following:

```yaml {configFile="routes"}
cache:
    enabled: true
    cookies: ["/SESS.*/", "__blackfire"]
```

## Get support

If you're experiencing issues with Blackfire and [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
information doesn't help, follow these steps:

1. Retrieve [startup errors](#1-retrieve-startup-errors).
2. Retrieve your [Blackfire logs](#2-retrieve-your-blackfire-logs).
3. Send this data to [Blackfire Support](https://support.blackfire.io).

### 1. Retrieve startup errors

To retrieve startup errors, run the following command:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} ssh -- php -d display_startup_errors=on --ri blackfire
```

### 2. Retrieve your Blackfire logs

To retrieve your Blackfire logs, follow these steps:

1.  On the environment where you're facing issues, create the following [variable](../../development/variables/set-variables.md):

    ```bash
    {{% vendor/cli %}} variable:create php:blackfire.log_file --value /tmp/blackfire.log
    ```

2.  To set the verbosity of the logs to level 4 (debug level), create the following variable:

    ```bash
    {{% vendor/cli %}} variable:create php:blackfire.log_level --value 4
    ```

3.  Start a profile or build.

4.  To display the logs, run the following command:

    ```bash
    {{% vendor/cli %}} ssh -- cat /tmp/blackfire.log > blackfire.log
    ```

After you've retrieved the logs, you can disable them.
To do so, run the following commands:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} variable:delete php:blackfire.log_file
{{% vendor/cli %}} variable:delete php:blackfire.log_level
```
