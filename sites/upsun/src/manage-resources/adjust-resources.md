When you first deploy your project or add a new app or service to it,
{{% vendor/name %}} allocates [default resources](/manage-resources/resource-init.md#default-resources) to each of your containers.
If you don't want to use those default resources, define a different [resource initialization strategy](/manage-resources/resource-init.md#define-a-resource-initialization-strategy).

After the initial deployment, or if you opt for the `Manual` [resource initialization strategy](/manage-resources/resource-init.md#define-a-resource-initialization-strategy),
you can adjust container resources manually.
To do, follow the instructions on this page.

{{% vendor/name %}} allows you to configure resources (CPU, RAM, and disk) per environment for each of your apps and services.
You can also add instances for each of your apps depending on your needs.

For example, you can scale vertically and allocate more resources to your production and staging environments
than to your development environments.
This flexibility allows you to optimize performance and costs.

You can even scale horizontally if your apps are struggling with high load, or if you're expecting a traffic spike,
by adding more instances for your apps and workers.

For information on costs related to resource usage, see the [{{% vendor/name %}} pricing page](https://upsun.com/pricing/).

Note that you can [monitor these costs](/administration/billing/monitor-billing.md) in the Console.

## Vertical scaling

To define how much CPU, RAM, and disk storage you want to allocate to each individual container,
follow these steps:

{{< codetabs >}}

+++
title= Using the CLI
+++

Run the `{{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set` command, and follow the prompts to set resources for each of your apps and services.

{{< note >}}

For further guidance on how to set resources using the CLI, run the `{{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set --help` command.

Note that if the deployment fails after you've run `{{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set`,
you may need to set the resources again.

{{< /note >}}

After you've set resources, your environment is redeployed,
which causes a short downtime.

1. Open your project.
2. Click the **Configure resources** button in the project card or the **App & Services** panel:
   ![Project card](/images/flexible-resources/configure-button-project-card.png "0.5")
3. For each app and service, select a CPU & RAM combination, and enter the amount of disk/storage you want to allocate.
   ![Configure your resources on the current environment window](/images/flexible-resources/configure-flexible-resources.png)
   {{< note >}}
   The values from the **CPU & RAM** menu depend on the [container profile](#advanced-container-profiles) of each instance.</br>
   If you deploy several instances of your app, the selected CPU & RAM combination isn't divided between those instances.
   Each instance benefits from the full, selected CPU & RAM.
   {{< /note >}}
4. Click **Save**.</br>
   You environment is redeployed, which causes a short downtime.

## Horizontal scaling

For apps and workers, you can also define how many instances you want to deploy.
To do so, follow these steps:

{{< note >}}

When you have several instances of an app, the {{% vendor/name %}} router randomly distributes requests to available instances.

title= Using the CLI
+++

To define how many instances of an app or worker you want to deploy,
you can use the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI's interactive prompts,
or run commands manually.

- **Interactive prompts:**

  Run the `{{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set` command, and follow the prompts to set resources for each of your apps and services.

  {{% note %}}
  For further guidance on how to set resources using the CLI, run the `{{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set --help` command.

  Note that if the deployment fails after you've run `{{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set`,
  you may need to set the resources again.
  {{% /note %}}

- **Manual commands:**

  To scale an app or worker, run the following command:

  ```bash {location="Terminal"}
  {{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set --count {{< variable "APP_NAME" >}}:{{< variable "NUMBER_OF_INSTANCES" >}}
  ```
  
  For example, to scale your `myapp` app to 3 instances, run the following command:

  ```bash {location="Terminal"}
  {{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set --count myapp:3
  ```

  You can also set the same instance count for all your apps using a wildcard.
  To do so, run the following command:
  
  ```bash {location="Terminal"}
  {{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set --count '*:{{< variable "NUMBER_OF_INSTANCES" >}}'
  ```

  For example, to scale all your apps to 3 instances, run the following command:

  ```bash {location="Terminal"}
  {{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set --count '*:3'
  ```
  {{% note %}}
  For further guidance on how to set resources using the CLI, run the `{{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set --help` command.

  After you've set the number of instances for your apps and workers, your environment is redeployed.
  If you've made no other changes, this redeployment causes no downtime.
  
  If the redeployment fails after you've run `{{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set`,
  you may need to set the resources again.
  {{% /note %}}

## Advanced: Container profiles

By default, {{% vendor/name %}} allocates a container profile to each app and service depending on the range of resources it's expected to need.

Each container profile gives you access to a specific list of CPU and RAM combinations.
Using the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI or Console, you can then pick a CPU and RAM combination for each of your apps and services.

There are four container profiles available: `HIGH_CPU`, `BALANCED`, `HIGH_MEMORY`, and `HIGHER_MEMORY`.
The following table displays the different CPU and RAM combinations each container profile provides:

| CPU  | `HIGH_CPU`   | `BALANCED` | `HIGH_MEMORY` | `HIGHER_MEMORY` |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 0.1  | 64 MB        | 352 MB     | 448 MB        | 864 MB          |
| 0.25 | 128 MB       | 640 MB     | 832 MB        | 1472 MB         |
| 0.5  | 224 MB       | 1088 MB    | 1408 MB       | 2368 MB         |
| 1    | 384 MB       | 1920 MB    | 2432 MB       | 3840 MB         |
| 2    | 704 MB       | 2800 MB    | 4032 MB       | 6336 MB         |
| 4    | 1216 MB      | 4800 MB    | 6720 MB       | 10496 MB        |
| 6    | 1728 MB      | 6080 MB    | 9024 MB       | 14080 MB        |
| 8    | 2240 MB      | 7296 MB    | 11200 MB      | 17408 MB        |

You can check which container profile is set for an app or service in your project from the Console.
To do so, navigate to your environment and select the app or service in the tree on the left-hand side:

### Adjust a container profile

In most cases, it's best not to adjust container profiles.
As a best practice, {{% vendor/name %}} recommends adjusting the profile of a container **only if the CPU/RAM ratio doesn’t match how the container scales**,
taking into account both production and preview (staging and development) environments.

To adjust a container profile, amend the value of the `container_profile` key in your configuration:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    {{< variable "APP_NAME" >}}:
        container_profile: HIGH_MEMORY

services:
    {{< variable "SERVICE_NAME" >}}:
        type: {{< variable "SERVICE_TYPE" >}}:{{< variable "VERSION" >}}
        container_profile: HIGHER_MEMORY
```
