If you have the [**Manage Billing** permission](/administration/users.md#organization-permissions) on your organization,
you can keep an eye on your costs related to resource usage.</br>
To do so, after you've set or updated resources on your project,
follow these steps in the [{{% vendor/name %}} Console](/administration/web/_index.md):

1. Navigate to your organization.
2. Open the user menu (your name or profile picture).
3. Click **Billing**.</br>
   A monthly estimate of how much each project is expected to cost is displayed.
4. You can also view the costs related to every project you've been added to.</br>
   To do so, click **{{< icon more >}} More** next to the project,
   and select **Project Billing**.</br>
   A monthly estimate of all the expected costs related to resource allocation on the project is displayed.

{{< note >}}

These estimates reflect the expected costs **for a full month** based on the way resources are allocated **at the time of viewing**.
They don't take into account the history of changes you may have made throughout the current month.</br>
Therefore, if you make changes to resource allocation during the month, your monthly invoice will differ from these estimates.
