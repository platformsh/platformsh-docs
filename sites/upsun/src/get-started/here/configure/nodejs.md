When dealing with Javascript/Node.js stacks, the information below may help customize your configuration.
These sections provide Javascript/Node.js-specific configuration details, but you can also refer to the common Upsun documentation:

- [Configuring applications](/create-apps)
- [Setting up managed services](/add-services)
- [Handling requests](/define-routes)

## Build flavors

By default, Upsun makes assumptions about how you want to build your application. 
Namely, that you are managing your dependencies with npm, and that the very first thing you'd like to run is a particular and common production flavor of `npm install`.

This is called a build `flavor`, but its assumption may prove inappropriate for your application and cause your builds to fail (such as if you'd like to use yarn or bun instead of npm).
Therefore, you can [disable this feature](/languages/nodejs#dependencies).

## Available package managers

Certain package managers come pre-installed on all Upsun `nodejs` container types:

* *npm*; example: ``npm install platformsh-config``
* *npx*; example: ``npx create-strapi-app <APP_NAME>``
* *bun*; example: ``bun install platformsh-config``

You can also use Yarn if you [install it explicitly](/languages/nodejs#use-yarn-as-a-package-manager), or [nvm](/languages/nodejs/node-version.md#use-nvm).

## Sample configuration

Below are some examples from common Node.js framework configuration:
