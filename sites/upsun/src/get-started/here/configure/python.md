When dealing with Python stacks, the information below may help customize your configuration.
These sections provide Python-specific configuration details, but you can also refer to the common {{% vendor/name %}} documentation:

- [Configuring applications](/create-apps)
- [Setting up managed services](/add-services)
- [Handling requests](/define-routes)

## Managing dependencies

Pip comes pre-installed in all `python` runtime containers. 
With it, you can add `pip install` to your build hook and be well on your way to builing your apps. 

Alternatively, you can [use a different package manager](/languages/python/dependencies), such as Poetry or Pipvenv.

## Configuring web servers

{{% vendor/name %}} doesn't enforce an assumption of what Python web server package you are using to serve your applications.
You can use any server on {{% vendor/name %}} by modifying the `web.commands.start` property of your application configuration.
For more information, see how to [configure web servers](/languages/python/server).

## Frameworks

The {{% vendor/name %}} documentation includes a wide array of community resources to help with framework-specific configuration:

- [Django](/get-started/stacks/django)
- [Flask](/get-started/stacks/flask)

## Get support

While there are virtually no restrictions to you deploying any kind of application on {{% vendor/name %}}, configuration may still be unclear at this point.

Not to worry! The {{% vendor/name %}} community is here to help. 
Come and say hello, share your work, ask for help, and peek in on what others are working on.
