    All you need to know about working locally with an {{% vendor/name %}} project.
---

A significant amount of work developing your app takes place locally rather than on an active {{% vendor/name %}} environment.
You want to ensure that the process of local development is as close as possible to a deployed environment.

You can achieve this through the following approaches:

- [Tethered local development](/get-started/here/local/tethered)
- DDEV (coming soon!)

Each of these approaches:

- Creates a local development environment for your site.
- Syncs data from the active {{% vendor/name %}} environment where team review takes place.
- Commits aspects of that local development method to the project so collaborators can replicate configuration to contribute.
