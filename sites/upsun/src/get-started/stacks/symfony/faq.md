    Troubleshoot issue you might encounter using [Symfony](https://www.symfony.com/), a PHP framework on {{% vendor/name %}}.

## Why is `DATABASE_URL` not defined during the build hook?

During the build hook, services are not available to avoid breaking the
application that is still live. That is why the Symfony integration does not
expose environment variables during the build hook.

The `cache:clear` command does not need to connect to the database by default,
except if you are using the Doctrine ORM and the database engine version is not
set in your configuration.

The version information can be set in your `.env` file or in the
`doctrine.yaml` configuration file. The only important pieces of information there are
the database engine and the version; everything else will be ignored.

Note that the environment variables are available in the deploy hook.

## How can I access my application logs?

To display the application log file (`app` file), run the following command:

```bash
symfony log app --tail
```

All the log messages generated by your app are sent to this `app` file.
This includes language errors such as PHP errors, warnings, notices,
as well as uncaught exceptions.
The file also contains your application logs if you log on `stderr`.

Note that {{% vendor/name %}} manages the `app` file for you.
This is to prevent disks from getting filled and using very fast local drives instead of slower network disks.
Make sure your apps always output their logs to `stderr`.

If you use Monolog, add the following configuration to your `config/packages/prod/monolog.yaml` file:

```gitignore
--- a/config/packages/prod/monolog.yaml
+++ b/config/packages/prod/monolog.yaml
@@ -11,7 +11,7 @@ monolog:
            members: [nested, buffer]
        nested:
            type: stream
-            path: "%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log"
+            path: php://stderr
            level: debug
        buffer:
            type: buffer
```

If you log deprecations, make sure you **also** log them on `stderr`.

## What's this "Oops! An Error Occurred" message about?

The *Oops! An Error Occurred* message comes from your app and is automatically generated based on the Symfony error template.

### The server returned a "500 Internal Server Error"

If your app's working as expected locally but you see the previous error message on {{% vendor/name %}},
it usually means you have a configuration error or a missing dependency.

To fix this issue, search your application logs.
They likely contain an error message describing the root cause:

```bash
symfony logs all
  [app] [14-Aug-2020 10:52:27 UTC] [critical] Uncaught PHP Exception Exception: [...]
  [app]
  [php.access] 2020-08-14T10:52:27Z GET 500 2.386 ms 2048 kB 419.11% /
  [access] 78.247.136.119 - - [14/Aug/2020:10:52:27 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500 843 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.125 Safari/537.36"
```

If the error occurs on a preview environment,
or on the main environment of a non-production project,
you can also enable Symfony's dev/debug mode to inspect the cause of the error:

```bash
# Enable debug mode
symfony env:debug
# Disable debug mode
symfony env:debug --off
```

### The server returned a "404 Not Found"

By default, new Symfony apps come without controllers, which means there's no homepage to show.
As a result, when you run your project locally, the following welcome page is displayed:

![The default Symfony welcome page in development mode](/images/symfony/new-symfony-welcome-page.png "0.45")

But when you run your project on {{% vendor/name %}}, the following error is displayed instead:

![A 404 error page in production mode](/images/symfony/production-error-404.png "0.35")

This is because {{% vendor/name %}} runs in production mode, leading Symfony to show a generic 404 error.
To fix this issue, [create your first Symfony page](https://symfony.com/doc/current/page_creation.html).

If you've already created a custom homepage, make sure you perform the following actions:

1. Commit all your files.
2. Run the `symfony deploy` command and check that the deployment is successful.
