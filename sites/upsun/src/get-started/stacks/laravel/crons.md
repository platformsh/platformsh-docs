    Understand how to configure Laravel cron jobs.
---

Cron jobs allow you to run scheduled tasks at specified times or intervals.

While you can run your own custom tasks, Laravel provides a scheduler to simplify the implementation.
To implement it, see the Laravel [Task Scheduling documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling).

## Set up a cron job

To set up a cron job, update your {{% vendor/name %}} configuration as follows:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    myapp:
        [...]
        crons:
            snapshot:
                spec: * * * * *
                cmd: |
                    php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Run cron jobs based on environment type

To run a command in a cron hook for specific environment types,
use the `PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` environment variable:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    myapp:
        [...]
        crons:
            snapshot:
                spec: 0 5 * * *
                cmd: |
                    # only run for the production environment, aka main branch
                    if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = "production" ]; then
                        php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
                    fi
```

## Run the Laravel scheduler every minute

Cron job execution on the default {{< vendor/name >}} offering are limited to once every 5 minutes. 
For more information, see the [documentation on crons](/create-apps/app-reference.html#crons).

However, you can add a [worker](/create-apps/app-reference#workers)
and specify a start command that [runs the scheduler every minute](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/scheduling#running-the-scheduler-locally).
To do so, use the following configuration:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    [...]
        {{< variable "APP_NAME" >}}:
            [...]
            workers:
                scheduler:
                    commands:
                        start: |
                            php artisan schedule:work
```

Web and worker containers don't share mount targets.
You can't share files between those containers using the filesystem.
To share data between containers, use [services](/add-services/_index.md).
