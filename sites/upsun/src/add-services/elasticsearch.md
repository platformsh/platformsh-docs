See the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html) for more information.

## Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

{{< image-versions image="elasticsearch" status="supported" environment="grid" >}}

## Deprecated versions

The following versions are still available in your projects for free,
but they're at their end of life and are no longer receiving security updates from upstream.

{{< image-versions image="elasticsearch" status="deprecated" environment="grid" >}}

To ensure your project remains stable in the future,
switch to [a premium version](#supported-versions).

Alternatively, you can switch to one of the latest, free versions of [OpenSearch](./opensearch.md).
To do so, follow the same procedure as for [upgrading](#upgrading).

## Relationship reference

For each service [defined via a relationship](#usage-example) to your application,
{{% vendor/name %}} automatically generates corresponding environment variables within your application container,
in the ``$<RELATIONSHIP-NAME>_<SERVICE-PROPERTY>`` format.

Here is example information available through the [service environment variables](/development/variables/_index.md#service-environment-variables) themselves,
or through the [``PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

{{< codetabs >}}
+++
title= Service environment variables
+++

You can obtain the complete list of available service environment variables in your app container by running ``{{% vendor/cli %}} ssh env``.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the [service environment variables](/development/variables/_index.md#service-environment-variables) directly rather than hard coding any values.

```bash
ESSEARCH_USERNAME=
ESSEARCH_SCHEME=http
ESSEARCH_SERVICE=elasticsearch
ESSEARCH_FRAGMENT=null
ESSEARCH_IP=123.456.78.90
ESSEARCH_HOSTNAME=azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.elasticsearch.service._.eu-1.{{< vendor/urlraw "hostname" >}}
ESSEARCH_PORT=9200
ESSEARCH_CLUSTER=azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti
ESSEARCH_HOST=essearch.internal
ESSEARCH_REL=elasticsearch
ESSEARCH_PATH=
ESSEARCH_QUERY=[]
ESSEARCH_PASSWORD=ChangeMe
ESSEARCH_TYPE=elasticsearch:{{< latest "elasticsearch" >}}
ESSEARCH_PUBLIC=false
ESSEARCH_HOST_MAPPED=false
```

<--->

+++
title= `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable
+++

For some advanced use cases, you can use the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
The structure of the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable can be obtained by running `{{< vendor/cli >}} relationships` in your terminal:

```json
{
    "username": null,
    "scheme": "http",
    "service": "elasticsearch",
    "fragment": null,
    "ip": "123.456.78.90",
    "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.elasticsearch.service._.eu-1.{{< vendor/urlraw "hostname" >}}",
    "port": 9200,
    "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti",
    "host": "essearch.internal",
    "rel": "elasticsearch",
    "path": null,
    "query": [],
    "password": "ChangeMe",
    "type": "elasticsearch:{{< latest "elasticsearch" >}}",
    "public": false,
    "host_mapped": false
}
```

Here is an example of how to gather [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) information in a [`.environment` file](/development/variables/set-variables.md#use-env-files):

```bash {location=".environment"}
# Decode the built-in credentials object variable.
export RELATIONSHIPS_JSON=$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode)

# Set environment variables for individual credentials.
export APP_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=="$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r '.essearch[0].host')"
```

{{< /codetabs >}}

For [premium versions](#supported-versions),
the service type is `elasticsearch-enterprise`.

## Usage example

### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `elasticsearch` type:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: elasticsearch:<VERSION>
```

If you’re using a [premium version](/add-services/elasticsearch.md#supported-versions), use the ``elasticsearch-enterprise`` type instead.

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost. Back up your data before changing the service.

### 2. Add the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {configFile="services"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        # The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
        # (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
        # See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
        relationships:
            <SERVICE_NAME>: 
services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: elasticsearch:<VERSION>
```

You can define `<SERVICE_NAME>` as you like, so long as it's unique between all defined services 
and matches in both the application and services configuration.

The example above leverages [default endpoint](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the _name_ of that service.

Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships).

With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship `<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>` and its corresponding [service environment variables](/development/variables/_index.md#service-environment-variables).

### Example configuration

```yaml {configFile="services"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    myapp:
        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        # The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
        # (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
        # See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
        relationships:
            elasticsearch: 

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    elasticsearch:
        type: elasticsearch:{{% latest "elasticsearch" %}}
```

If you’re using a [premium version](/add-services/elasticsearch.md#supported-versions), use the ``elasticsearch-enterprise`` type instead.

### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

Note that configuration for [premium versions](#supported-versions) may differ slightly.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
{{% snippet name="myapp" config="app" root="myapp"  %}}

# Other options...

# Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
relationships:
    essearch: "elasticsearch:elasticsearch"
{{% /snippet %}}
{{% snippet name="elasticsearch" config="service" placeholder="true"  %}}
    type: elasticsearch:{{% latest "elasticsearch" %}}
{{% /snippet %}}
```

This configuration defines a single application (`myapp`), whose source code exists in the `<PROJECT_ROOT>/myapp` directory.</br>
`myapp` has access to the `elasticsearch` service, via a relationship whose name is [identical to the service name](#2-add-the-relationship)
(as per [default endpoint](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships) configuration for relationships).

From this, `myapp` can retrieve access credentials to the service through the [relationship environment variable](/add-services/elasticsearch.md#relationship-reference).

```bash {location="myapp/.environment"}
# Set environment variables for individual credentials,
# For more information, please visit {{< vendor/urlraw "docs" >}}/development/variables.html#service-environment-variables.
export ELASTIC_SCHEME=${ESSEARCH_SCHEME}
export ELASTIC_HOST=${ESSEARCH_HOST}
export ELASTIC_PORT=${ESSEARCH_PORT}

# Surface more common Elasticsearch connection string variables for use in app.
export ELASTIC_USERNAME=${ESSEARCH_USERNAME}
export ELASTIC_PASSWORD=${ESSEARCH_PASSWORD}
export ELASTIC_HOSTS=["$ELASTIC_SCHEME://$ELASTIC_HOST:$ELASTIC_PORT"]
```

The above file — ``.environment`` in the ``myapp`` directory — is automatically sourced by {{% vendor/name %}} into the runtime environment, so that the variable ``ELASTIC_HOSTS`` can be used within the application to connect to the service.

Note that ``ELASTIC_HOSTS``, and all [{{% vendor/name %}}-service environment variables](/development/variables/_index.md#service-environment-variables) like ``ESSEARCH_HOST``,
are environment-dependent.
Unlike the build produced for a given commit,
they can’t be reused across environments and only allow your app to connect to a single service instance on a single environment.

A file very similar to this is generated automatically for your when using the ``{{% vendor/cli %}} ify`` command to [migrate a codebase to {{% vendor/name %}}](/get-started/_index.md).

{{< note >}}

When you create an index on Elasticsearch,
don't specify the `number_of_shards` or `number_of_replicas` settings in your Elasticsearch API call.
These values are set automatically based on available resources.

{{< /note >}}

## Authentication

By default, Elasticsearch has no authentication.
No username or password is required to connect to it.

Starting with Elasticsearch 7.2 you may optionally enable HTTP Basic authentication.
To do so, include the following in your `{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}` configuration:

```yaml {configFile="services"}
{{% snippet name="elasticsearch" config="service"  %}}
    type: elasticsearch:{{% latest "elasticsearch" %}}
    configuration:
        authentication:
            enabled: true
{{% /snippet %}}
```

If you're using a [premium version](#supported-versions),
use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type.

That enables mandatory HTTP Basic auth on all requests.
The credentials are available in any relationships that point at that service,
in the `username` and `password` properties.

You can obtain the complete list of available service environment variables in your app container by running ``{{% vendor/cli %}} ssh env``.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the [service environment variables](/development/variables/_index.md#service-environment-variables) directly rather than hard coding any values.

This functionality is generally not required if Elasticsearch isn't exposed on its own public HTTP route.
However, certain applications may require it, or it allows you to safely expose Elasticsearch directly to the web.
To do so, add a route to `{{< vendor/configfile "routes" >}}` that has `elasticsearch:elasticsearch` as its upstream
(where `elasticsearch` is whatever you named the service).

For example:

```yaml {configFile="routes"}
{{% snippet name="elasticsearch:elasticsearch" config="route" subDom="es" redirect="false" / %}}
{{% snippet name="elasticsearch" config="service" placeholder="true"  %}}
    type: elasticsearch:{{% latest "elasticsearch" %}}
    configuration:
        authentication:
            enabled: true
{{% /snippet %}}
```

## Plugins

Elasticsearch offers a number of plugins.
To enable them, list them under the `configuration.plugins` key in your `{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}` file, like so:

```yaml {configFile="services"}
{{% snippet name="elasticsearch" config="service"  %}}
    type: elasticsearch:{{% latest "elasticsearch" %}}
    configuration:
        plugins:
            - analysis-icu
{{% /snippet %}}
```

If you're using a [premium version](#supported-versions),
use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type.

In this example you'd have the ICU analysis plugin and Python script support plugin.

If there is a publicly available plugin you need that isn't listed here, [contact support](/learn/overview/get-support.md).

### Plugin removal

Removing plugins previously added in your `{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}` file doesn't automatically uninstall them from your Elasticsearch instances.
This is deliberate, as removing a plugin may result in data loss or corruption of existing data that relied on that plugin.
Removing a plugin usually requires reindexing.

To permanently remove a previously enabled plugin,
[upgrade the service](#upgrading) to create a new instance of Elasticsearch and migrate to it.
In most cases it isn't necessary as an unused plugin has no appreciable impact on the server.

## Upgrading

The Elasticsearch data format sometimes changes between versions in incompatible ways.
Elasticsearch doesn't include a data upgrade mechanism as it's expected that all indexes can be regenerated from stable data if needed.
To upgrade (or downgrade) Elasticsearch, use a new service from scratch.

There are two ways to do so.

### Destructive

In your `{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}` file, change the version *and* name of your Elasticsearch service.
Be sure to also update the reference to the now changed service name in its corresponding application's `relationship` block.

When you push that to {{% vendor/name %}}, the old service is deleted and a new one with the new name is created with no data.
You can then have your application reindex data as appropriate.

This approach has the downsides of temporarily having an empty Elasticsearch instance,
which your application may or may not handle gracefully, and needing to rebuild your index afterward.
Depending on the size of your data that could take a while.

### Transitional

With a transitional approach, you temporarily have two Elasticsearch services.
Add a second Elasticsearch service with the new version, a new name, and give it a new relationship in `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}`.
You can optionally run in that configuration for a while to allow your application to populate indexes in the new service as well.

Once you're ready to switch over, remove the old Elasticsearch service and relationship.
You may optionally have the new Elasticsearch service use the old relationship name if that's easier for your app to handle.
Your application is now using the new Elasticsearch service.

This approach has the benefit of never being without a working Elasticsearch instance.
On the downside, it requires two running Elasticsearch servers temporarily,
each of which consumes resources and needs adequate disk space.
Depending on the size of your data, that may be a lot of disk space.
