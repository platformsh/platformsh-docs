It exposes an HTTP API for client interaction. See the [InfluxDB documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb) for more information.

## Supported versions

{{% major-minor-versions-note configMinor="true" %}}

{{< image-versions image="influxdb" status="supported" environment="grid" >}}

{{% image-versions-legacy "influxdb" %}}

## Deprecated versions

The following versions are still available in your projects,
but they're at their end of life and are no longer receiving security updates from upstream.

{{< image-versions image="influxdb" status="deprecated" environment="grid" >}}

To ensure your project remains stable in the future,
switch to a [supported version](#supported-versions).
See more information on [how to upgrade to version 2.3 or later](#upgrade-to-version-23-or-later).

title= `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable
+++

For some advanced use cases, you can use the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
The structure of the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable can be obtained by running `{{< vendor/cli >}} relationships` in your terminal:

```json
{
  "host": "influxdb.internal",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.influxdb.service._.eu-1.{{< vendor/urlraw "hostname" >}}",
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-bvxea6i",
  "service": "influxdb",
  "type": "influxdb:{{< latest "influxdb" >}}",
  "rel": "influxdb",
  "scheme": "http",
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "ChangeMe",
  "port": 8086,
  "path": null,
  "query": {
    "org": "main",
    "bucket": "main",
    "api_token": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm1234567890"
  },
  "fragment": null,
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90"
}
```

Here is an example of how to gather [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) information in a [`.environment` file](/development/variables/set-variables.md#use-env-files):

```bash {location=".environment"}
# Decode the built-in credentials object variable.
export RELATIONSHIPS_JSON=$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode)

# Set environment variables for individual credentials.
export APP_INFLUXDB_HOST="$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r '.influxdb[0].host')"
```

{{< /codetabs >}}

## Usage example

{{% endpoint-description type="influxdb" /%}}

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    myapp:
        # The location of the application's code.
        source:
            root: "/"

        [...]

        # Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
        relationships:
            influxdb:

service:
    influxdb:
        type: influxdb:{{% latest "influxdb" %}}
```

{{% v2connect2app serviceName="influxdb" relationship="influxdbdatabase" var="INFLUX_HOST"%}}

```bash {location="myapp/.environment"}
# Set environment variables for common InfluxDB credentials.
# For more information, please visit {{< vendor/urlraw "docs" >}}/development/variables.html#service-environment-variables.
export INFLUX_USER=${INFLUXDB_USERNAME}
export INFLUX_HOST=${INFLUXDB_HOST}
export INFLUX_ORG=$(echo $INFLUXDB_QUERY | jq -r ".org")
export INFLUX_TOKEN=$(echo $INFLUXDB_QUERY | jq -r ".api_token")
export INFLUX_BUCKET=$(echo $INFLUXDB_QUERY | jq -r ".bucket")
```

{{% /v2connect2app %}}

## Export data

To export your data from InfluxDB, follow these steps:

1. Install and set up the [`influx` CLI](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/tools/influx-cli/).
2. Connect to your InfluxDB service with the [{{% vendor/name %}} CLI](../administration/cli/_index.md):

   ```bash
   {{% vendor/cli %}} tunnel:single
   ```

   This opens an SSH tunnel to your InfluxDB service on your current environment and produces output like the following:

   ```bash
   SSH tunnel opened to {{<variable "RELATIONSHIP_NAME" >}} at: http://127.0.0.1:30000
   ```

3. Get the username, password and token from the [relationship](#relationship-reference) by running the following command:

   ```bash
   {{% vendor/cli %}} relationships -P {{<variable "RELATIONSHIP_NAME" >}}
   ```

4. Adapt and run [InfluxDB's CLI export command](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.3/reference/cli/influx/backup/).

    ``` bash
    influx backup --host {{< variable "URL_FROM_STEP_2" >}} --token {{< variable "API_TOKEN_FROM_STEP_3" >}}
    ```

## Upgrade to version 2.3 or later

### From a previous 2.x version

From version 2.3 onward, the structure of relationships changes.

If you're using a prior 2.x version, your app might currently rely on pulling the `bucket`, `org`, `api_token`,
or `user` values available in the [`{{< vendor/prefix >}}_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](#relationship-reference).

If so, to ensure your upgrade is successful, make the following changes to your connection logic:

- Rename the `user` key to `username`.
- Move the `org`, `bucket` and `api_token` keys so they're contained in a dictionary under the `query` key.

If you're relying on any other attributes connecting to InfluxDB, they remain accessible as environment variable from the [service environment variable](#relationship-reference), aside from those addressed above:

### From a 1.x version

From version 2.3 onward, InfluxDB includes an upgrade utility that can convert databases from previous versions to version 2.3 or later.

To upgrade from a 1.x version to 2.3 or later,
change the service version in your `{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}` file and push your project.
Any existing data you had in your 1.x system is automatically upgraded for you into the 2.3+ system.

{{< note >}}

During an upgrade from a 1.x version to a 2.3 version or later,
a new admin password and a new admin API token are automatically generated.
Previous credentials can't be retained.

You can retrieve your new credentials through the [service environment variables](development/variables.html#service-environment-variables).
