Edge Analytics enables enterprises to collect analytics data at the edge, rather than in the browser. This approach helps prevent data loss caused by ad blockers, privacy restrictions, or performance limitations. 

Built on Edgee’s open-source technology and Upsun’s global CDN and edge infrastructure, it delivers analytics in a privacy-compliant manner without impacting website performance. 

Edge Analytics integrates with platforms such as GA4, Amplitude, and Segment, providing an edge-based solution for data collection and analysis.

**Before you begin you need:**
- An up-and-running {{% vendor/name %}} [Fixed or Flex](/administration/organizations.html#fixed-and-flex-organizations) project
- [Fastly CDN subscription](/domains/cdn.html)

## Setup Edgee
Edge Analytics integrates smoothly with your existing {{% vendor/name %}} infrastructure and analytics tools. Our structured onboarding process includes dedicated technical sessions, staged deployment, and continuous support to ensure successful implementation.
