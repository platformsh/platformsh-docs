[Redis](https://redis.io/documentation) is a multi-model database that allows you to store data in memory
for high-performance data retrieval and key-value storage.
{{% vendor/name %}} supports two different Redis configurations:

- [Persistent](#persistent-redis): to set up fast persistent storage for your application
- [Ephemeral](#ephemeral-redis): to set up a non-persistent cache for your application

title= `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable
+++

For some advanced use cases, you can use the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
The structure of the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable can be obtained by running `{{< vendor/cli >}} relationships` in your terminal:

```json
{
    "username": null,
    "scheme": "redis",
    "service": "redis",
    "fragment": null,
    "ip": "123.456.78.90",
    "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.redis.service._.eu-1.{{< vendor/urlraw "hostname" >}}",
    "port": 6379,
    "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti",
    "host": "redis.internal",
    "rel": "redis",
    "path": null,
    "query": [],
    "password": null,
    "type": "redis:{{% latest "redis" %}}",
    "public": false,
    "host_mapped": false
}
```

Here is an example of how to gather [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) information in a [`.environment` file](/development/variables/set-variables.md#use-env-files):

```bash {location=".environment"}
# Decode the built-in credentials object variable.
export RELATIONSHIPS_JSON=$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode)

# Set environment variables for individual credentials.
export APP_REDIS_HOST="$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r '.redis[0].host')"
```

{{< /codetabs >}}

The format of the relationship is identical whether your Redis service is [ephemeral](#ephemeral-redis) or [persistent](#persistent-redis).

## Persistent Redis

By default, Redis is an ephemeral service that stores data in memory.
This allows for fast data retrieval,
but also means data can be lost when a container is moved or shut down.

To solve this issue, configure your Redis service as persistent.
Persistent Redis stores data on a disk,
restoring it if the container restarts.

To switch from persistent to ephemeral Redis,
set up a new service with a different name.

{{% note theme="warning" title="Warning" %}}

{{% vendor/name %}} sets the maximum amount of memory (`maxmemory`) Redis can use for the data set,
and it cannot be amended.
It is defined by comparing the following values and keeping the lower of the two:

- Disk size/6 (based on a [recommendation from Redis](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/installing-upgrading/install/plan-deployment/hardware-requirements/#productionenvironment))
- The amount of memory allocated to the service container

For instance, if your Redis container has 3072 MB of disk space and 1024 MB of memory,
only 512 MB of RAM are actually available to the service (3072/6 = 512).

But if your Redis container has 3072 MB of disk space and 256 MB of memory,
only 256 MB of RAM are actually available to the service (as per the container limit).

{{% /note %}}

### Usage example

#### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `redis-persistent` endpoint:

```yaml {configFile="services"}
services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: redis-persistent:<VERSION>
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

#### 2. Add the relationship

To define the relationship, use the `redis` endpoint :

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        source:
            root: "myapp"
        
        [...]

        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            <SERVICE_NAME>:

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: redis-persistent:<VERSION>
```

You can define `<SERVICE_NAME>` as you like, so long as itâ€™s unique between all defined services and matches in both the application and services configuration.

The example above leverages [default endpoint](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships) configuration for relationships. That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships) (the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.

Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration, you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships).

With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship `<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>` and its corresponding [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables#use-provided-variables).

For PHP, enable the [extension](/languages/php/extensions) for the service:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        source:
            root: "myapp"
        
        [...]

        runtime:
            extensions:
                - redis

        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            <SERVICE_NAME>:

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: redis-persistent:<VERSION>
```

### Configuration example

#### [Service](/add-services/_index.md) and [app](/create-apps/_index.md) configuration

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        source:
            root: "myapp"
        
        [...]

        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            redis:

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    redis:
        type: redis-persistent:{{% latest "redis" %}}
```

### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        source:
            root: "myapp"
        
        [...]

        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            redis:

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    redis:
        type: redis-persistent:{{% latest "redis" %}}
```

{{% v2connect2app serviceName="redis" relationship="redis" var="CACHE_URL"%}}

```bash {location="myapp/.environment"}
# Set environment variables for individual credentials.
# For more information, please visit {{< vendor/urlraw "docs" >}}/development/variables.html#service-environment-variables.
export CACHE_HOST="${REDIS_HOST}"
export CACHE_PORT="${REDIS_PORT}"
export CACHE_PASSWORD="${REDIS_PASSWORD}"
export CACHE_SCHEME="${REDIS_SCHEME}"

# Surface a Redis connection string for use in app.
export CACHE_URL="${CACHE_SCHEME}://${CACHE_PASSWORD}@${CACHE_HOST}:${CACHE_PORT}"
```

{{% /v2connect2app %}}

## Ephemeral Redis

By default, Redis is an ephemeral service that serves as a non-persistent cache.
Ephemeral Redis stores data only in memory and requires no disk space.
When the service reaches its memory limit, it triggers a cache cleanup.
To customize those cache cleanups, set up an [eviction policy](#eviction-policy).

Make sure your app doesn't rely on ephemeral Redis for persistent storage as it can cause issues.
For example, if a container is moved during region maintenance,
the `deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks don't run and an app that treats the cache as permanent shows errors.

To prevent data from getting lost when a container is moved or shut down,
you can use the [persistent Redis](#persistent-redis) configuration.
Persistent Redis provides a cache with persistent storage.

### Usage example

#### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `redis` endpoint:

```yaml {configFile="services"}
services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: redis:<VERSION>
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

#### 2. Add the relationship

To define the relationship, use the `redis` endpoint :

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        source:
            root: "myapp"
        
        [...]

        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            <SERVICE_NAME>:

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: redis:<VERSION>
```

You can define `<SERVICE_NAME>` as you like, so long as itâ€™s unique between all defined services and matches in both the application and services configuration.

The example above leverages [default endpoint](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships) configuration for relationships. That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships) (the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.

Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration, you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships).

With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship `<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>` and its corresponding [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables#use-provided-variables).

For PHP, enable the [extension](/languages/php/extensions) for the service:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        source:
            root: "myapp"
        
        [...]

        runtime:
            extensions:
                - redis

        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            <SERVICE_NAME>:

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: redis:<VERSION>
```

### Configuration example

#### [Service](add-services/_index.md) and [app](/create-apps/_index.md) configuration

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        source:
            root: "myapp"
        
        [...]

        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            redis:

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    redis:
        type: redis:{{% latest "redis" %}}
```

### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        source:
            root: "myapp"
        
        [...]

        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            redis:

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    redis:
        type: redis:{{% latest "redis" %}}
```

{{% v2connect2app serviceName="redis" relationship="redis" var="CACHE_URL"%}}

```bash {location="myapp/.environment"}
# Set environment variables for individual credentials.
# For more information, please visit {{< vendor/urlraw "docs" >}}/development/variables.html#service-environment-variables.
export CACHE_HOST="${REDIS_HOST}"
export CACHE_PORT="${REDIS_PORT}"
export CACHE_PASSWORD="${REDIS_PASSWORD}"
export CACHE_SCHEME="${REDIS_SCHEME}"

# Surface a Redis connection string for use in app.
export CACHE_URL="${CACHE_SCHEME}://${CACHE_PASSWORD}@${CACHE_HOST}:${CACHE_PORT}"
```

{{% /v2connect2app %}}

## Multiple databases

Redis 3.0 and above support up to 64 databases.
But you can't set up different access rights to each database.
When you set up a relationship connection,
access to all of the databases is automatically granted.

The way to access a particular database depends on the [client library](https://redis.io/clients) you're using:

{{< codetabs >}}

+++
title=PHP
+++

Use the Redis [`select` command](https://redis.io/commands/select):

```php
<?php
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect(getenv('REDIS_HOST'), getenv('REDIS_PORT'));

$redis->select(0);       // switch to DB 0
$redis->set('x', '42');  // write 42 to x
$redis->move('x', 1);    // move to DB 1
$redis->select(1);       // switch to DB 1
$redis->get('x');        // returns 42
```

<--->

+++
title=Python
+++

To manage [thread safety](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/blob/master/docs/advanced_features.rst#user-content-a-note-about-threading),
the Python library suggests using separate client instances for each database:

```python
import os
from redis import Redis

database0 = Redis(host=os.getenv('REDIS_HOST'), port=os.getenv('REDIS_PORT'), db=0)
database1 = Redis(host=os.getenv('REDIS_HOST'), port=os.getenv('REDIS_PORT'), db=1)
```

<--->

+++
title=Node.js
+++

Use the Redis [`select` command](https://redis.io/commands/select):

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');

const client = redis.createClient(process.env.REDIS_PORT, process.env.REDIS_HOST);

await client.SELECT(0);                  // switch to DB 0
await client.set('x', '42');             // write 42 to x
await client.MOVE('x', 1);               // move to DB 1
await client.SELECT(1);                  // switch to DB 1
const value = await client.get('x');     // returns 42
```

{{< /codetabs >}}

## Eviction policy

When Redis reaches its memory limit,
it triggers a cache cleanup.
To customize those cache cleanups, set up an eviction policy such as the following:

```yaml {configFile="services"}
services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    redis:
        type: "redis:{{% latest "redis" %}}"
        configuration:
            maxmemory_policy: allkeys-lfu
```

The following table presents the possible values:

| Value             | Policy description                                                                                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `allkeys-lru`     | Removes the oldest cache items first. This is the default policy when `maxmemory_policy` isn't set.         |
| `noeviction`      | New items arenâ€™t saved when the memory limit is reached.                                                    |
| `allkeys-lfu`     | Removes least frequently used cache items first.                                                            |
| `volatile-lru`    | Removes least recently used cache items with the `expire` field set to `true`.                              |
| `volatile-lfu`    | Removes least frequently used cache items with the `expire` field set to `true`.                            |
| `allkeys-random`  | Randomly removes cache items to make room for new data.                                                     |
| `volatile-random` | Randomly removes cache items with the `expire` field set to `true`.                                         |
| `volatile-ttl`    | Removes cache items with the `expire` field set to `true` and the shortest remaining `time-to -live` value. |

For more information on the different policies,
see the official [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/reference/eviction/).

## Access your Redis service through the Redis CLI

After you've [configured your Redis service](#usage-example),
you can access it using the [Redis CLI](https://redis.io/docs/ui/cli/).

Retrieve the hostname and port you can connect to
through the [service environment variable](#relationship-reference).
To do so, run the `{{< vendor/cli >}} ssh env` command.

After you've retrieved the hostname and port, [open an SSH session](../development/ssh/_index.md).
To access your Redis service, run the following command:

```bash
redis-cli -h {{< variable "REDIS_HOSTNAME" >}} -p {{< variable "REDIS_PORT" >}}
```

{{% version/specific %}}
If you have a Grid project, note that the `CONFIG GET` and `CONFIG SET` admin commands are restricted.
To get the current configuration, run the following command:
<--->
Note that the `CONFIG GET` and `CONFIG SET` admin commands might be restricted on your project.
{{% /version/specific %}}

```bash
redis-cli -h {{< variable "REDIS_HOSTNAME" >}} -p {{< variable "REDIS_PORT" >}} info
```

## Use Redis as a handler for PHP sessions

A PHP session allows you to store different data for each user through a unique session ID.
By default, PHP handles sessions using files.
But you can use Redis as a session handler,
which means Redis stores and retrieves the data saved into sessions.

To set up Redis as your session handler, add a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    myapp:
        source:
            root: "myapp"

            type: "php:{{% latest "php" %}}"

            relationships:
                redissession:

            variables:
                php:
                    session.save_handler: redis
                    session.save_path: "tcp://{{< variable "$SESSIONSTORAGE_HOSTNAME" >}}:{{< variable "$SESSIONSTORAGE_PORT" >}}"

            web:
                locations:
                    '/':
                        root: 'web'
                        passthru: '/index.php'
                        
services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    redissession:
        type: "redis-persistent:{{% latest "redis" %}}"
```
