## Lock wait timeout

If a process running in your application acquired a lock from MySQL for a long period of time,
you receive MySQL error messages like this:

```sql
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1205 Lock wait timeout exceeded;
```

This is typically caused by one of the following:

* There are multiple places acquiring locks in different order.
  For example, code path 1 first locks record A and then locks record B,
  while code path 2 first locks record B and then locks record A.
* There is a long running background process executed by your application that holds the lock until it ends.

If you're using [MariaDB 10+](./_index.md), use the SQL query `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST \G` to list DB queries waiting for locks.
To determine where to debug, find output like the following:

```sql
< skipped >
Command: Query
Time: ...
State: Waiting for table metadata lock
Info: SELECT ...
< skipped >
```

To find active background processes, run `ps aufx` on your application container.

Make sure that locks are acquired in a pre-defined order and released as soon as possible.

## Definer/invoker of view lack rights to use them

There is a single MySQL user, so you can not use "DEFINER" Access Control mechanism for Stored Programs and Views.

When creating a `VIEW`, you may need to explicitly set the `SECURITY` parameter to `INVOKER`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SQL SECURITY INVOKER
VIEW `view_name` AS
SELECT
```

## Server has gone away

### Disk space issues

Errors such as `PDO Exception 'MySQL server has gone away'` are usually the result of exhausting your available disk space.
Get an estimate of current disk usage using the CLI command `{{% vendor/cli %}} db:size`.
Just keep in mind it's an estimate and not exact.

Allocate more space to the service by running the `upsun resources:set` command.
For more information, see how to [manage resources](/manage-resources.md).

As table space can grow rapidly,
it's usually advisable to make your database mount size twice the size reported by the `db:size` command.

You may want to add a [low-disk warning](../../integrations/notifications.md#low-disk-warning)
to learn about low disk space before it becomes an issue.

### Packet size limitations

`MySQL server has gone away` errors may be caused by the size of the database packets.
If so, the logs may show warnings like `Error while sending QUERY packet` before the error.

One way to resolve the issue is to use the [`max_allowed_packet` parameter](./_index.md#configure-the-database).

### Worker timeout

`MySQL server has gone away` errors may be caused by server timeouts.
MySQL has a built-in timeout for idle connections, which defaults to 10 minutes.
Most typical web connections end long before that's ever approached,
but a long-running worker may idle and not need the database for longer than the timeout, leading to a "server has gone away" message.

The best approach is to wrap your connection logic in code that detects a "server has gone away" exception
and tries to re-establish the connection.

Alternatively, if your worker is idle for too long it can self-terminate.
{{% vendor/name %}} automatically restarts the worker process and the new process can establish a new database connection.
