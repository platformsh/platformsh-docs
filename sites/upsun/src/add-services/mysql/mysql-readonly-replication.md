description: Configure and access read-only MariaDB replicas to ease the load on a primary database.
---

You can improve the performance of read-heavy applications by defining read-only replicas of your MariaDB database and then connecting your applications to those replicas. 

Examples of read-heavy applications include: 
- Listing pages or dashboards
- Reporting or analytics jobs
- Background jobs that frequently query data

- **Replication is asynchronous**: Delays of a few milliseconds might occur between writes on the primary database and reads on the replica database.
- **Replicas are read-only**: This restriction ensures data consistency and integrity. Attempts to modify data will result in an SQL error.

### Read-only vs. external replicas
Read-only replicas are used primarily to improve application performance by distributing database read requests from read-heavy applications.  

Other common use cases for read-only replicas include: 
- Cross-region backup: Replicating data to different geographical regions
- Data warehousing: Extracting data from production to analytics projects

[External replicas](/add-services/mysql/mysql-replication.md) reside on remote servers and have different use cases, including disaster recovery.

### Replica scope and sharing services {#replica-scope-sharing-services}
MariaDB services (which provide access to databases and replicas) defined in a project cannot be accessed by or shared with applications in other projects.

## 1. Configure the primary and replica services 

The following code fragment defines two MariaDB services: a primary and a replica. You can use this fragment as a template by copying it into your `services.yaml` or `application.yaml` file. 

Be sure to: 
- Replace `<VERSION>` with the [supported MariaDB version](/add-services/mysql/_index.md#supported-versions) that you need. Use the same version number for the primary and replica services.
- **Important:** Use `replicator` as the endpoint name when you define the replica service. This is a special endpoint name that the replica service uses to connect to the database.

```yaml {configFile="services"}
services:
  db:
    type: mariadb:<VERSION>
    configuration:
      schemas:
        - main
      endpoints:
        main:
          default_schema: main
          privileges:
              main: admin
          replicator:
            privileges:
              main: replication

  db-replica1:
    type: mariadb-replica:<VERSION>
    configuration:
      schemas:
        - main
      endpoints:
        main:
          default_schema: main
          privileges:
            main: admin
      relationships:
      primary: db:replicator # Do not change the name `primary`. The service expects to receive this name.

  db-replica2:
    type: mariadb-replica:<VERSION>
    configuration:
      schemas:
        - main
      endpoints:
        main:
          default_schema: main
          privileges:
            main: admin
      relationships:
      primary: db:replicator # Do not change the name `primary`. The service expects to receive this name.
```

### How it works

Using the sample code fragment above: 

1. The primary service (`db`) defines an additional `replicator` endpoint, granting the `replication` privilege. This enables a replica to connect and continuously replicate data from the primary database. 

    ```yaml
    replicator:
      privileges:
        main: replication
    ```

2. The replica services (`db-replica1` and `db-relica2`) use the `mariadb-replica` image type and connect back to the primary database service through the primary relationship. This establishes a replication link from `db` (the source) to `db-replica` (the target).

    ```yaml
    relationships:
      primary: db:replicator
    ```
    
The `db-replica1` and `db-replica2` replica services continuously stream data from the primary endpoint, maintaining a read-only copy of the primary database content. Write operations are not permitted on the replicas. 


## 2. Define the relationship between the application and the replicas

Even if your application won't access the replication endpoint, you must expose the endpoint to an application as a relationship so that you can connect to it over SSH.

Define a new relationship in your application container, as shown below:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
name: myapp

[...]

# Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
relationships:
  # More information: https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
  database:
    service: db
    endpoint: main
  database-readonly:
    service: db-replica
```

If your application's performance is still not what you expect, you can configure additional replicas as described above.
