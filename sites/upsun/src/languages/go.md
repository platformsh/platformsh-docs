## Supported versions

{{% major-minor-versions-note configMinor="true" %}}

{{< image-versions image="golang" status="supported" environment="grid" >}}

{{% language-specification type="golang" display_name="Go" %}}

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The app's name, which must be unique within the project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        type: 'golang:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The app's name, which must be unique within the project.
    app:
        type: 'golang:{{% latest "golang" %}}'
```

## Go modules

The recommended way to handle Go dependencies on {{% vendor/name %}} is using Go module support in Go 1.11 and later. That allows the build process to use `go build` directly without any extra steps, and you can specify an output executable file of your choice. (See the examples below.)

## Building and running the application

Assuming your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are present in your repository, your application can be built with the command `go build`, to produce a working executable. You can then start it from the `web.commands.start` directive. Note that the start command _must_ run in the foreground. If the program terminates for any reason it is automatically restarted.

The following basic `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` file is sufficient to run most Go applications.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The app's name, which must be unique within the project.
    app:
        type: 'golang:{{% latest "golang" %}}'

        hooks:
            build: |
                # Modify this line if you want to build differently or
                # use an alternate name for your executable.
                go build -o bin/app

        web:
            upstream:
                socket_family: tcp
                protocol: http

            commands:
                # If you change the build output in the build hook above, update this line as well.
                start: ./bin/app

            locations:
                /:
                    # Route all requests to the Go app, unconditionally.
                    allow: false
                    passthru: true
```

Note that there is still an Nginx proxy server sitting in front of your application.
If desired, certain paths may be served directly by Nginx without hitting your application (for static files, primarily)
or you may route all requests to the Go application unconditionally, as in the example above.

## Accessing services

To access various [services](../add-services/_index.md) with Go, see the following examples. The individual service pages have more information on configuring each service.
