Optional. By default, {{% vendor/name %}} allocates a container profile to each app and service depending on the range of resources itâ€™s
expected to need.

Each container profile gives you access to a specific list of CPU and RAM combinations.
Using the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI or Console, you can then pick a CPU and RAM combination for each of your apps and services.
