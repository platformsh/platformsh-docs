Learn about the image properties you can define in the an application configuration file.

The image properties below are used to configure both single-runtime images and composable images. Although thethe images use many of the same property names, the details or syntax differ depending on the context. These differences are noted within the topic.

For details about the properties that are unique to each image type, refer to the [Single-runtime image](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#) and [Composable image](/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#) topics.
