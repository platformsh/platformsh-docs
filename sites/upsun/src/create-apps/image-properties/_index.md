**Note:** The properties below are available in both single-runtime and composable images. 
For most of these properties, the syntax and details are the same for both image types. Differences in meaning and syntax are noted as needed in the property details.

To learn about the properties that are **unique to each image type**, refer to the [single-runtime image](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#) and [composable image](/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#) topics.
