description: A variables dictionary that defines variables to control the environment.
---

Optional in [single-runtime](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#primary-application-properties) and [composable](/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#primary-application-properties) images in {{% vendor/name %}}.

{{% description %}}

{{% vendor/name %}} provides a number of ways to set [variables](/development/variables/_index.md).
Variables set in your app configuration have the lowest precedence,
meaning they're overridden by any conflicting values provided elsewhere.

All variables set in your app configuration must have a prefix.
Some [prefixes have specific meanings](/development/variables/_index.md#variable-prefixes).

Variables with the prefix `env` are available as a separate environment variable.
All other variables are available in
the [`PLATFORM_VARIABLES` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

The following example sets two variables:

- A variable named `env:AUTHOR` with the value `Juan` that's available in the environment as `AUTHOR`
- A variable named `d8config:system.site:name` with the value `My site rocks`
  that's available in the `PLATFORM_VARIABLES` environment variable
