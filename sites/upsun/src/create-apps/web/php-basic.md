To handle dynamic requests to your PHP app, you might want to use a [front controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller).
The following example shows how for such an app you might start defining [your web server](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web).

## Define a document root

Start by defining your document root (where all your publicly visible pages are).

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    myapp:
        source:
            root: "/"
        web:
            locations:
                '/':
                    root: 'public'
```

## Define a front controller

Define where all requests that don't match a file in the document root are sent.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    myapp:
        source:
            root: "/"
        web:
            locations:
                '/':
                    root: 'public'
                    passthru: '/index.php'
                    index:
                        - index.php
```

In this case, `/index.php` acts as a front controller and handles dynamic requests.

Because it handles dynamic requests, you want to ensure that scripts are enabled
and responses aren't cached.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    myapp:
        source:
            root: "/"
        web:
            locations:
                '/':
                    ...
                    scripts: true
                    # No caching for static files.
                    # (Dynamic pages use whatever cache headers are generated by the program.)
                    expires: -1
```

## Define rules

You might want to define specific rules for the location.
For example, you might want to allow all kinds of files except mp4 files.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    myapp:
        source:
            root: "/"
        web:
            locations:
                '/':
                    ...
                    # Allow all file types generally
                    allow: true
                    rules:
                        # Disallow .mp4 files specifically.
                        \.mp4$:
                            allow: false
```

## Set different rules for specific locations

You might want to set specific rules for specific locations.
For example, you might have files in your `/public/images` directory that are served at `/images`.
You could define a specific cache time for them and limit them to only static image files.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    myapp:
        source:
            root: "/"
        web:
            locations:
                '/':
                    ...
                # Set a 5 min expiration time for static files in this location.
                # Missing files are sent to front controller
                # through the '/' location above.
                '/images':
                    expires: 300
                    passthru: true
                    # Do not execute PHP scripts from this location and do not
                    # deliver their source code (for enhanced security).
                    scripts: false
                    allow: false
                    rules:
                        # Only allow static image files in this location
                        '\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svgz?|ico|bmp)$':
                            allow: true
```

        web:

                '/':
                    root: 'public'
                    passthru: '/index.php'
                    index:
                        - index.php
                    scripts: true
                    # No caching for static files.
                    # (Dynamic pages use whatever cache headers are generated by the program.)
                    expires: -1
                    # Allow all file types generally
                    allow: true
                    rules:
                        # Disallow .mp4 files specifically.
                        \.mp4$:
                            allow: false
                # Set a 5 min expiration time for static files in this location.
                # Missing files are sent to front controller
                # through the '/' location above.
                '/images':
                    expires: 300
                    passthru: true
                    # Do not execute PHP scripts from this location and do not
                    # deliver their source code (for enhanced security).
                    scripts: false
                    allow: false
                    rules:
                        # Only allow static image files in this location
                        '\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svgz?|ico|bmp)$':
                            allow: true
```
