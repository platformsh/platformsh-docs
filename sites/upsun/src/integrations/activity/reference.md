description: A reference of the properties found in various activities.
---

Activities log changes to your project,
including when you deploy your app,
when you [push code](#push), and when a [cron job is run](#cron).

To automate your workflows, you can parse and react to the activity's JSON object
through [activity scripts](../activity/_index.md).

## Activity schema

Every activity has a corresponding JSON object containing all information for that activity,
including timestamps, configuration, and sometimes logs.
In practice, you can ignore much of the JSON object's content.
The most commonly used values are documented in this reference.

The response differs depending on the activity and doesn't always include all fields.

### Example response

The following is a shortened example of a response for an [environment sync activity](/glossary.md#sync).
You can also see [complete examples of responses](#examples).

```

### `id`

A unique `id` value to identify the activity itself.

### `*_at`

`created_at`, `started_at`, `updated_at`, `cancelled_at`, `completed_at`, and `expires_at` are all timestamps in UTC.
For when a given activity occurred, use `completed_at`.
You can use these properties to calculate the duration of the activity.
To calculate the timing for steps in the activity, see the [`timings` property](#timings).

### `parameters`

The `parameters` property includes detailed information about what triggered the activity,
such as the user, the impacted environment, the git commits, or the cron commands.
The response changes based on the activity.

### `project`

The ID of the project in which the activity took place.
Use this value to distinguish multiple projects sent the same URL.

Different from [`project` activities](#type).

### `type`

The type of the activity in one of the following categories:

- [Project](#project-activity-types)
- [Environment](#environment-activity-types)
- [Integration](#integration-activity-types)
- [Maintenance](#maintenance-activity-types)

#### `project` activity types

Activities that happened on a given project.
The following table presents the possible activity types:

## Maximum activities and parallelism

Project activities are distributed across separate queues,
which enables *two* simultaneous activities to occur in parallel across your environments.
For a given environment, only one activity can run at a time.
Those queues include the following types of activities:

| Name           | Description                                                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`      | The most common activities on repositories (pushes, merges) and environments (syncs, redeployments). |
| `integrations` | Source and webhook integration activities.                                                           |
| `backup`       | Backup activities.                                                                                   |
| `cron`         | Cron activities.                                                                                     |

Production activities are prioritized across all queues.
When an activity for the production environment is triggered, it's placed at the top of the queue.
This makes it unlikely that activities on preview environments block activities for the production environment for long,
though there may be a temporary wait.

## Examples

The response is often usually long, so the following examples are shortened using ellipses.
Remember that the response differs depending on the activity and not all fields are always available.

To test responses, [set up a webhook](./webhooks.md#setup).

### Cron

When a cron job is triggered, the activity contains all the [job's information](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons).
The following example response was triggered by a setting
where the cron is scheduled to run every five minutes (`5 * * * *`)
with the command `sleep 60 && echo sleep-60-finished && date` and times out after 86,400 seconds.

To get details about the configured cron job, see the `parameters` property:

``` json
...
  "parameters": {
    "user": "admin",
    "cluster": "abcdefgh1234567-main-abcd123",
    "environment": "main",
    "application": "app",
    "cron": "saybye",
    "spec": {
      "spec": "5 * * * *",
      "commands": {

        "stop": null
      },
      "shutdown_timeout": null,
      "timeout": 86400
    }
...
```

### Push

A push activity contains several properties.
The `commits` property contains everything related to the Git push that triggered the activity:

``` json
...
    "commits": [
      {
        "sha": "2bab04e050279ac078d5d34016f5dd9c466e948d",
        "author": {
          "email": "cloeweber@example.com",
          "name": "Cloé Weber",
          "date": 1671032461
        },
        "parents": [
          "6aac318907b50252976c47e4e62ed95d438af0ea"
        ],
        "message": "Add cron"
      }
    ],
...
```

The `environment` property contains the settings for the environment that was pushed to:

``` json
