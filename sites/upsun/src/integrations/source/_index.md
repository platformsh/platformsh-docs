You might want to keep your code in a third-party repository that's linked to your {{% vendor/name %}} project.
This means you keep all your workflows where you want and use {{% vendor/name %}} for deploying.

Your {{% vendor/name %}} project becomes a mirror of your code repository elsewhere.
This means you shouldn't push code directly to {{% vendor/name %}}.
Any changes you push directly get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in the third-party repository.
