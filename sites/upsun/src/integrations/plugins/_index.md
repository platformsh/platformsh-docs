These applications run in a secure sandbox environment to ensure they don't interfere with the Upsun console core functionality.

Plugins can be built using different technologies than the Upsun console itself - they have been successfully tested with React, Vue.js, and other modern frameworks, giving developers the flexibility to use their preferred tools and technologies.

A plugin must be installed by each user who requires access to it.

## Install a plugin

1. Go to https://console.upsun.com/-/add-plugin and log in with your Upsun credentials.

1. Copy the pluginâ€™s manifest URL into the **Manifest URL** field and click **Create**. 

## Update or uninstall a plugin

1. Go to https://console.upsun.com/-/add-plugin and log in with your Upsun credentials. 

1. Find the plugin to update or remove, click the three dots to the right of the plugin name, and choose an action:
      - **Update**: Update the plugin by reloading the plugin URL.
      - **Remove**: Uninstall the plugin.
