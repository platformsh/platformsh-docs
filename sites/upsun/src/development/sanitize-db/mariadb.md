To sanitize your database and get rid of sensitive, live information, use the `drush sql:sanitize` command.
Add your script to sanitize the database to [a `deploy` hook](../../create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook)
for preview environments:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
hooks:
    deploy: |
        cd /app/public
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ]; then
            # Do whatever you want on the production site.
        else
            drush -y sql:sanitize
        fi
        drush -y updatedb
```

More options are available.
These are described in the [Drush documentation](https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/sql_sanitize/).

To sanitize only on the initial deploy and not all future deploys,
use [Drush state](https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/state_set/) as in the following example:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
hooks:
    deploy: |
        cd /app/public
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ] && [ "$(drush state:get --format=string mymodule.sanitized)" != yes ]; then
            # Do whatever you want on the production site.
        else
            drush -y sql:sanitize
            drush state:set --input-format=string mymodule.sanitized yes
        fi
```

If your database contains a lot of data, consider using the [`OPTIMIZE TABLE` statement](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/optimize-table/)
to reduce its size and help improve performance.
