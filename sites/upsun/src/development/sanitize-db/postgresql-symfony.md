title=Using a Symfony Command
+++

Assumptions:

- An Entity User exist and contains all of your PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- [fakerphp/faker](https://fakerphp.github.io/) has been installed as a dependency on your Symfony application

Set up a script by following these steps:
1.  Create a Symfony command to sanitize data

    ```php {location="src/Command/SanitizeDataCommand.php"}
    <?php
    namespace App\Command;

    use App\Entity\User;
    use App\Repository\UserRepository;
    use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;
    use Faker;
    use Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command;
    use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
    use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
    use Symfony\Component\Console\Style\SymfonyStyle;

    class SanitizeDataCommand extends Command
    {
        protected static $defaultName = 'app:sanitize-data';

        protected static $defaultDescription = 'Sanitize user data (username and email).';

        public function __construct(
          private UserRepository $userRepository,
          private EntityManagerInterface $entityManager
        )
        {
            parent::__construct();
        }

        protected function configure()
        {
            $this->setDescription('This command allows you to sanitize user data (username and email).');
        }

        protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)
        {
            $io = new SymfonyStyle($input, $output);

            $users = $this->userRepository->findAll();
            $io->progressStart(count($users));

            /** @var User $user */
            foreach ($users as $user) {
                $io->progressAdvance();

                // initialize faker
                $faker = Faker\Factory::create();

                // sanitize user info
                $user->setUsername(uniqid($faker->userName()));
                $user->setEmail($faker->email());
                // adapt to your needs

                $this->entityManager->flush();
            }
            $io->progressFinish();

            return static::SUCCESS;
        }
    }
    ```

2.  Update the deploy hook to run your Symfony Command on each deploy.

    ```yaml {configFile="app"}
    hooks:
        build: ...
        deploy: |
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" != production ]; then
            # The sanitization of the database should happen here (since it's non-production)
            php bin/console app:sanitize-data
        fi
    ```

    To sanitize only on the initial deploy and not all future deploys, on sanitization create a file on a mount. Then add a check for the file as in the following example:

    ```yaml {configFile="app"}
    hooks:
        build: ...
        deploy: |
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" != production ] && [ ! -f MOUNT_PATH/is_sanitized ]; then
            # The sanitization of the database should happen here (since it's non-production)
            php bin/console app:sanitize-data
            touch MOUNT_PATH/is_sanitized
        fi
    ```

3.  Commit your changes by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git add src/Command/SanitizeDataCommand.php {{< vendor/configfile "app" >}} && git commit -m "Add sanitization."
    ```

    Push the changes to `staging` and verify that environment's database was sanitized.
    Once merged to production, all data from future preview environments are sanitized on environment creation.

title=Using a shell script
+++
This example show you how to sanitize data on multiple projects inside an organization, except for production environments.

Assumptions:

- Symfony Command from previous tab `Using a Symfony Command` has already been pushed to all of your environments.

Set up a script by following these steps:


1.  Create an executable sanitizing script by running the following command:

    ```bash
    touch sanitize_fleet.sh && chmod +x sanitize_fleet.sh
    ```

3.  Make the script sanitize environments with an [environment type](../../administration/users.md#environment-type-roles)
    other than `production`.

    The following example runs only in preview environments
    and sanitizes data using the Symfony Command from previous tab, already pushed to all of your environments.

    ```bash {location="sanitize_fleet.sh"}
    if [ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ]; then emulate -L ksh; fi

4.  use this shell script

    Depending on the machine you want to run this script on, adapt this to your needs.

    ```bash
    . sanitize_fleet.sh  # or source sanitize_fleet.sh
    ORGANIZATION=<organizationIdentifier>
    sanitize_organization_data $ORGANIZATION
    ```

{{< note >}}
You can find the organization identifier for a specific project, within the {{% vendor/name %}} console, by clicking on your name, and then on “Settings”, in the top right corner.
{{< /note >}}


4.  [Option] Commit your changes by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git add sanitize_fleet.sh && git commit -m "Add sanitization."
    ```

    Push the changes to `staging` and verify that environment's database was sanitized.
    Once merged to production, all data from future preview environments are sanitized on environment creation.

If your database contains a lot of data, consider using the [`REINDEX` statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-reindex.html) to help improve performance.
