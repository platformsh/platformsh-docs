description: Manage team access and permissions across all your projects and organizations.
---

Organizations on {{% vendor/name %}} are made up of both [projects](/projects/) and [users](/administration/users.md).
While organizations by themselves allow you to assign project and environment type permissions to individual users on certain projects,
having many users and projects calls for another method to group common access control settings.

**Teams** provide a grouping that connects a group of organization's users to a specified group of organization's projects.
That relationship enables organization owners to set default Project and environment type access settings for each user and project from one place.

There is no limit to the number of teams that can be defined within a single organization.

## Create a new team

As an organization owner or member with **Manage users** permissions, 
you can create new teams.

Teams must belong to an organization, so [create one]() first.
You can create new organizations with different payment methods and billing addresses
and organize your projects as you want, but keep in mind that both users and teams are restricted to single organizations.

title=Using the Console
+++

1. Navigate to your existing organization.
1. Open the user menu (your name or profile picture).
1. Select **Teams** from the dropdown.
1. Click **+ Create team**.
1. Enter the information for your team. Only the team name is required at this point, but you can define environment type permissions now if you'd like.
1. Click **Create team**.

<--->
+++
title=Using the CLI
+++

Assuming you have already created the organization `deploy-friday-agency`, retrieve that {{% variable "ORGANIZATION_ID" %}} with the command:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} organization:info -o deploy-friday-agency id
```

Then use that {{% variable "ORGANIZATION_ID" %}} to create a new team for your organization's "Frontend developers" by running:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} api:curl -X POST /teams \
    -d "{'organization_id':'{{% variable "ORGANIZATION_ID" %}}','label':'Frontend Developers'}" 
```

That command will provide a {{% variable "TEAM_ID" %}}, which you can use to verify the team was created successfully:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} api:curl -X GET /teams/{{% variable "TEAM_ID" %}}
```

{{< /codetabs >}}

## Delete an existing team

As an organization owner or member with **Manage users** permissions, 
you can delete existing teams.

Note that deleting teams and deleting users are not equivalent.
Deleting a team will remove member access permissions to projects described by the team,
but it will _not_ [remove users from the organization](/administration/users.md#remove-a-user-from-an-organization) (or your billing).

```

The response will include a {{% variable "TEAM_ID" %}} for the team `Frontend developers`.
Use that ID to delete the team:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} api:curl -X DELETE /teams/{{% variable "TEAM_ID" %}}
```

{{< /codetabs >}}


## Manage team settings

As an organization owner or member with **Manage users** permissions, 
you can manage the settings of existing teams such as:

- [It's name](#team-name)
- [The environment type permissions granted to members on individual projects](#project--environment-type-permissions)
- [Team members](#team-members)
- [Project access](#team-access-to-projects)

### Team members

#### Add users to a team

To join a team, a user must already have been added [to the organization](/administration/users.md#manage-organization-access),
where their [organization permissions](/administration/users.md#organization-permissions) are defined.
