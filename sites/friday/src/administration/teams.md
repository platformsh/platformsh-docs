{{< partial "user-mgt-sellable/body.md" >}}

Organizations on {{% vendor/name %}} are made up of both [projects](/projects/) and [users](/administration/users.md).
While organizations by themselves allow you to assign project and environment type permissions to individual users on individual projects,
having many users and many projects calls for another method to group common access control settings.

**Teams** provide a grouping that connects a subset of an organization's users to another subset of that organization's projects.
That relationship enables organization owners to set default project and environment type access settings for each user and project from one place.

There is no limit to the number of teams that can be defined within a single organization.

## Create a new team

As an organization owner or member with **Manage users** permissions, 
you can create new teams.

Teams must belong to an organization, so [create one](/administration/organizations.md#create-a-new-organization) first.
You can create new organizations with different payment methods and billing addresses
and organize your projects as you want, but keep in mind that both users and teams are restricted to single organizations.

## Delete an existing team

As an organization owner or member with **Manage users** permissions, 
you can delete existing teams.

Note that deleting teams and deleting users are not equivalent.
Deleting a team will remove member access permissions to projects described by the team,
but it will _not_ [remove users from the organization](/administration/users.md#remove-a-user-from-an-organization) (or your billing).
