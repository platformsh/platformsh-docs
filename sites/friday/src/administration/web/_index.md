![Overview of projects in the Console](/images/console/upsun-console-main-view.png "0.6")

This Console offers you ways to manage projects and environments other than the [command line interface (CLI))](../cli/_index.md).

## Project list

Opening the [Console](https://console.upsun.com) takes you to the first organization you joined  as a 
{{% vendor/name %}} user.
You get an overview of all your projects within that organization.
You can narrow the list down by searching for specific projects,
or switch to a different organization from the menu in the top left-hand corner.

Once you select a project, you can [configure the project settings](./configure-project.md).
You can also choose individual environments within the project and [configure each environment](./configure-environment.md).

You can also create a new project by clicking **+ Create project**.

## Display settings

You can personalize the display settings for the Console.
To do so:

1. Open the user menu (your name or profile picture).
2. Click **My Profile**.
3. Choose the mode you want.
4. Click **Save**.

The Console can be displayed in three ways:

* Light mode (default)
* High contrast mode
* Dark mode

To meet our [commitment to accessibility](https://platform.sh/trust-center/legal/wcag/),
all three options are compliant with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.
