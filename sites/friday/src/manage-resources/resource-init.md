When you first deploy your {{% vendor/name %}} project, and whenever you add a new app or service,
{{% vendor/name %}} allocates the following default resources to every container:

| Resource type               | Amount |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| CPU                         | 0.5 |
| RAM                         | Depends on the [container profile](/manage-resources/adjust-resources.md#advanced-container-profiles). |
| Disk size (only applicable if the app or service requires a disk)                   | 512 MB |

If you don't want to use those default resources, you can define a different [resource initialization strategy](/manage-resources/resource-init.md#define-a-resource-initialization-strategy).
You can also [adjust those resources](/manage-resources/adjust-resources.md) after your project or new container has been deployed.

For information on costs related to resource usage, see the [{{% vendor/name %}} pricing page](https://upsun.com/pricing/).
Note that you can [keep an eye on those costs](/manage-resources/resource-billing.md) in the Console.

## Define a resource initialization strategy

You can define which strategy {{% vendor/name %}} uses to allocate resources
when you first deploy your project or add a new container.
The following strategies are available:

| Strategy | Description |
| ---------| ----------- |
| `default`  | Initializes the new containers using the [{{% vendor/name %}} default resources](/manage-resources/resource-init.md). |
| `manual`   | With this strategy, the first deployment fails and you need to configure resources manually through [the Console](/manage-resources/adjust-resources.md), or using `resources:set` in the CLI. |
| `minimum`  | Initializes the new containers using the [{{% vendor/name %}} minimum resources](#minimum-resources). |
| `parent`   | Initializes the new containers using the same resources as the parent environment.</br>If there is no parent environment, or if the container doesn't already exist on the parent, the `default` strategy applies instead. |

{{< note >}}

Unless you explicitly set another resource initialization strategy, the following strategies are used:

- `default` when you first deploy your project or a new service/application
- `parent` for a new environment created through a [source integration](/integrations/_index.md)

If you're not using a [source integration](/integrations/_index.md),
you can use a [Git push option](/environments/_index.md#push-options) to define which strategy {{% vendor/name %}} uses to allocate resources
when you first deploy your project or add a new container.

To do so, run the following command:

```bash
upsun push --resources-init={{< variable "INITIALIZATION_STRATEGY" >}}
```

For example, to use the `minimum` strategy for your deployment, run the following command:

```bash
upsun push --resources-init=minimum
```

Alternatively, you can use the official Git syntax for [push options](/environments/_index.md#push-options):

```bash
git push upsun -o resources.init=minimum
```

You can set a different resource initialization strategy for each of your deployments.

title= With a source integration
+++

If you're using a [source integration](/integrations/_index.md),
to define which strategy {{% vendor/name %}} uses to allocate resources when you first deploy your project or add a new container,
use the `--resources-init` flag.

{{< note >}}

Once a resource initialization strategy is set for your source integration,
it applies to **all** the deployments you launch through that source integration.

{{< /note >}}

To specify a resource initialization strategy when you [create your source integration](/integrations/source/_index.md),
include the `--resources-init` flag in your source integration options.
For example, if you [set up a GitHub integration](), use the following options:

```bash
platform integration:add \
  --project {{< variable "PROJECT_ID" >}} \
  --type github \
  --repository {{< variable "OWNER/REPOSITORY" >}} \
  --token {{< variable "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN" >}} \
  --base-url {{< variable "GITHUB_URL" >}}
  --resources-init {{< variable "INITIALIZATION_STRATEGY" >}}
```

To specify a resource initialization strategy for an existing source integration,
run the following command:

```bash
upsun integration:update --resources-init={{< variable "INITIALIZATION_STRATEGY" >}}
```

For example, to use the `minimum` strategy for your deployment, run the the following command:

```bash
upsun integration:update --resources-init=minimum
```

### Minimum resources

The following table shows the resources {{% vendor/name %}} allocates to your containers when you opt for the `minimum` [resource initialization strategy](#define-a-resource-initialization-strategy).

\* The disk size is set to `None` when the container never uses a disk, and to `0 MB` when the container doesn't require a disk but can use one.

## Actions on environments

Here is how resource allocation works on {{% vendor/name %}} when you perform the following actions on an environment:

### Environment creation

When you [branch an environment](/glossary.md#branch) to create a new child environment,
the child environment inherits all the resources from its parent.

### Environment merge

When you [merge](/glossary.md#merge) a child environment into a parent environment,
any app or service on the child environment is merged into the parent.
For the merge and deployment to be complete,
you need to [allocate resources](/manage-resources/adjust-resources.md) to each of these newly added instances.

### Environment sync

When you [sync an environment](/glossary.md#sync),
the target environment's disk size may be smaller that the source environment's disk size.

In this case, to ensure that the synchonization succeeds, {{% vendor/name %}} automatically adjusts the target environment's disk size so it matches the source environment's disk size.
