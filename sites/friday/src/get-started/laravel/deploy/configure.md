  Review the basics of what makes up a {{< vendor/name >}} project, including its YAML configuration file and how to define it for Laravel.
---


You now have a *project* created on {{< vendor/name >}}.

In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.

*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers via a [YAML file](/learn/overview/yaml).

## Recommended: use the CLI configurator

The recommended way is to use the {{< vendor/name >}} CLI that has a
`{{< vendor/cli >}} project:init` command. This command has a cool 
`{{< vendor/cli >}} ify` shortcut. Let's {{< vendor/cli >}}ify your Laravel application!

The `{{< vendor/cli >}} project:init` command automatically detects the framework, the runtime, and
the dependency managers used by your application.

![Routes](/images/guides/laravel-ify.png "0.5")

You will be invited to give your project a name and select the different services you intend to use.

The `{{< vendor/cli >}} project:init` command provide a [list of services](add-services.md)
whose configuration will be bootstraped for you. Use arrows to move the selector,
space to select a service and type to filter the list.

In this exemple, MySQL and Redis were selected.

You could add as many services to your application as you wish. Depending on your
application complexity, the `{{< vendor/cli >}} project:init` command might not generate the whole
configuration files for you, but will get your started with 80% to 90% of it ready.
## Configure apps

Your app configuration in the `applications` top-level key of the `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` file
allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.

For all of the options, see a [complete reference](/create-apps/app-reference.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

## Add services

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the `services` top-level key of the `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

You can [add other services](/add-services/_index.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure Laravel to use those services once they're enabled.

Each service entry has a name (`db` and `cache` in the example)
and a `type` that specifies the service and version to use.
Services that store persistent data have a `disk` key, to specify the amount of storage.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
# The services of the project.
#
# Each service listed will be deployed
# to power your Upsun project.
# More information: https://docs.deployfriday.net/add-services.html
# Full list of available services: https://docs.deployfriday.net/add-services.html#available-services
services:
  mysql:
    type: mysql:10.6 # All available versions are: 10.6, 10.5, 10.4, 10.3

  redis:
    type: redis:7.0 # All available versions are: 7.0, 6.2

```

## Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching
you define in the `routes` top-level key of the `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.
Generally, you want the user session cookie, which is included in the example for Laravel.
You may need to add other cookies depending on what additional modules you have installed.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the
equivalent URL without `www`. HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't define a routes top-level key in the {{< vendor/configfile "routes" >}}
file, a single default route is used. This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
routes:
  https://{default}/:
    type: upstream
    upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a Laravel app:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun.
# More information: https://docs.deployfriday.net/define-routes.html
routes:
  "https://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "my-laravel-app:http"
  # A basic redirect definition
  # More information: https://docs.deployfriday.net/define-routes.html#basic-redirect-definition
  "https://www.{default}":
    type: redirect
    to: "https://{default}/"

```

## Configure writable cache directories

Laravel requires specific cache folders to be writable. [Mounts](/create-apps/app-reference.html#mounts)
define directories that are writable after the build is complete.

Let's ensure the `bootstrap/cache` and `storage` directories are writable
by checking the `mounts` definition of your `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` file:

```yaml
mounts:
    ...

    "bootstrap/cache":
      source: "local"
      source_path: "cache"

    "storage":
      source: "local"
      source_path: "storage"
```

A Laravel specific cache folder should be created, if missing, while the application
is being deployed. [Multiple hooks](/create-apps/app-reference.html#hooks) run
as part of the process of building and deploying your app. These are places where
you can run custom scripts, such as this `deploy` hook that ensures caches are correctly
set up and warmed:

```yaml
deploy: |
    set -eux

    # ensure the cache directories are available
    mkdir -p storage/framework/cache/data
    mkdir -p storage/framework/views
    mkdir -p storage/framework/sessions

    # clear all caches and dumped files
    php artisan optimize:clear

    # run all available migrations
    php artisan migrate --force
```


## Commit and bridge with {{% vendor/name %}}

Now that you have Laravel configured, let's commit all you configuration files:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add {{< vendor/name >}} configuration files"
```

The following step is to connect it with Laravel Bridge.
