[Blackfire.io](../../../increase-observability/application-metrics/blackfire.md)
continuous observability solution is included with your {{< vendor/name >}}
subscription and activated out of the box on your PHP and Python applications.

[Blackfire Monitoring](https://blackfire.io/docs/monitoring-cookbooks/index) is
enabled by default on all your production environments. You can
[trigger profiles](https://blackfire.io/docs/profiling-cookbooks/index) on any of
your environments to understand the root cause of identified bottlenecks to the
function or service calls level.

[Performance tests](https://blackfire.io/docs/testing-cookbooks/index) for your
Laravel applications can be automated and triggered each time a branch is
deployed (after a push, merge, or redeploy event).

This `.blackfire.yaml` [example file](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/laravel/blob/master/.blackfire.yaml)
may help you bootstrap the writing of your performance tests.

For advanced cases, the Blackfire PHP SDK provides the following integrations with Laravel:
- [Laravel Artisan](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/laravel/artisan)
- [Laravel Horizon and other queue services](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/laravel/horizon)
- [Laravel Tests](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/laravel/tests)
- [Laravel Octane](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/laravel/octane)
