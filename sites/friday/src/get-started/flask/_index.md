# Guide to deploying a Flask app on {{% vendor/name %}}

If you're more of a just-give-me-the-steps type of person, you can jump straight to the
[TL;DR step-by-step](/get-started/flask/tldr.md) section of this guide.

This guide provides instructions for deploying, and working with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) on
{{% vendor/name %}}. If you are unfamiliar with Flask, it is a lightweight and popular web framework for building web
applications using Python. It is often referred to as a "micro" framework because it provides the essential components
for building web applications but leaves many decisions and extensions up to the developer.
