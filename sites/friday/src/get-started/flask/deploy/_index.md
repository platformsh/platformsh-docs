{{< note title="Tip" >}}

To get your Flask project up and running as quickly as possible, experiment with the [{{% vendor/name %}} demo app](https://console.upsun.com/projects/create-project/demo) before following this guide.

If you're more of a just-give-me-the-steps type of person, you can jump straight to the
[fast-track](/get-started/flask/deploy/tldr.md) section.

{{< /note >}}

This guide provides instructions for deploying, and working with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) on
{{% vendor/name %}}. If you are unfamiliar with Flask, it is a lightweight and popular web framework for building web
applications using Python. It is often referred to as a "micro" framework because it provides the essential components
for building web applications but leaves many decisions and extensions up to the developer.
