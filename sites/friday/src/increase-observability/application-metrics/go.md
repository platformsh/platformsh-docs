Continuous profiling is a performance optimization technique where web applications
are monitored and profiled in real-time. Lightweight and scalable, it's tailored
for holistic application oversight.

Continuous profiling collects performance data continuously, enabling developers to
gain deep insights into their application's behavior, identify bottlenecks, and
optimize code for better performance and resource utilization. This proactive
approach allows for quicker identification and resolution of performance issues,
ensuring the smooth running of software in live environments.

## Continuous profiling on {{% vendor/name %}}

{{< vendor/name >}} Continuous Profiling is powered by [Blackfire](../../../increase-observability/application-metrics/blackfire.md).
It is available directly from Console under the `Profiling` tab of your environments.

## Prerequisites

{{< vendor/name >}} Continuous Profiler requires [`Go >=1.18`](/languages/go.md).

## Installation

Get the [Blackfire Continuous Profiler Go library](https://github.com/blackfireio/go-continuous-profiling):

```bash
go get github.com/blackfireio/go-continuous-profiling
```

## Go continuous profiler API

The Go continuous profiler API has two functions:

```go
func Start(opts ...Option) error {}
func Stop() {}
```

### `func Start(opts ...Option) error`

`Start` starts the continuous profiler probe. It collects profiling information and uploads
it to the Blackfire Agent periodically.

```go
profiler.Start(
       profiler.WithCPUDuration(3 * time.Second),
       profiler.WithCPUProfileRate(1000),
       profiler.WithProfileTypes(profiler.CPUProfile, profiler.HeapProfile, profiler.GoroutineProfile),
       profiler.WithLabels({
            "key1": "value1",
            "key2": "value2",
       }),
       profiler.WithUploadTimeout(5 * time.Second),
)
defer profiler.Stop()
```

The `Start` function accepts the following options:

- `WithCPUDuration`: specifies the length at which to collect CPU profiles.
The default is 45 seconds. Can also be set via the environment variable `BLACKFIRE_CONPROF_CPU_DURATION`.

- `WithCPUProfileRate`: sets the CPU profiling rate to Hz samples per second.
The default is defined by the Go runtime as 100 Hz. Can also be set via the environment
variable `BLACKFIRE_CONPROF_CPU_PROFILERATE`.

- `WithProfileTypes`: sets the profiler types. Multiple profile types can be set (`profiler.CPUProfile`, `profiler.HeapProfile`, `profiler.GoroutineProfile`).
The default is `Profiler.CPUProfile`.

- `WithLabels`: sets custom labels specific to the profile payload that is sent.

- `WithUploadTimeout`: sets the upload timeout of the message that is sent to the Blackfire Agent.
The default is 10 seconds. Can also be set via the environment variable `BLACKFIRE_CONPROF_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT`.

{{% note theme="info" title="Note:" %}}
If the same parameter is set by both an environment variable and a `Start` call, the explicit
parameter in the `Start` call takes precedence.
{{% /note %}}

There is also some additional configuration that can be done using environment variables:

- `BLACKFIRE_LOG_FILE`: Sets the log file. The default is logging to `stderr`.

- `BLACKFIRE_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the log level. The default is logging only errors.

### `func Stop()`

Stops the continuous profiling probe.


## A simple example application

1. Get the Blackfire Continuous Profiler Go library

```bash
go get github.com/blackfireio/go-continuous-profiling
```

2. Save the following code as `main.go` and run as follows:

```bash
go run main.go
```

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/md5"
	"encoding/hex"
	"io"
	"time"

	profiler "github.com/blackfireio/go-continuous-profiling"
)

func doSomethingCpuIntensive() {
	md5Hash := func(s string) string {
		h := md5.New()
		io.WriteString(h, s)
		return hex.EncodeToString(h.Sum(nil))
	}
	for i := 0; i < 1_000_000; i++ {
		md5Hash("UpsunIsCoolAndSoAreYou")
	}
}

func main() {
	err := profiler.Start(
		profiler.WithAppName("my-app"),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic("Error while starting Profiler")
	}
	defer profiler.Stop()

	for i := 0; i < 15; i++ {
		doSomethingCpuIntensive()

		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	}
}
```
