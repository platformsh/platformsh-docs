      "type": "clickhouse:23",
      "public": false
    }
```

## Usage example

### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `clickhouse` type:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: clickhouse:<VERSION>
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost. Back up your data before changing the service.

### 2. Add the relationship

To define the relationship, use one of the following endpoints.

#### `clickhouse` endpoint

The `clickhouse` endpoint allows you to use the Native Protocol port (also known as ClickHouse TCP protocol).
This protocol is used by ClickHouse apps and processes such as `clickhouse-server`, `clickhouse-client`, and native ClickHouse tools. It is also used for inter-server communication for distributed queries.

Use the following configuration:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>: "<SERVICE_NAME>:clickhouse"

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: clickhouse:<VERSION>
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, but it’s best if they’re distinct.
With this definition, the application container (``<APP_NAME>``) now has access to the service via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>``.

#### `clickhouse-http` endpoint

The `clickhouse-http` endpoint allows you to use the HTTP API Port for HTTP requests.
This protocol is used by [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/), [ODBC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/microsoft-open-database-connectivity-odbc?view=sql-server-ver16), and web interfaces.

Use the following configuration:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
applications:
    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    <APP_NAME>:
        # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
        relationships:
            <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>: "<SERVICE_NAME>:clickhouse-http"

services:
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    <SERVICE_NAME>:
        type: clickhouse:<VERSION>
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, but it’s best if they’re distinct.
With this definition, the application container (``<APP_NAME>``) now has access to the service via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>``.

```yaml {configFile="app"}

    # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
    myapp:
        # The location of the application's code.
        source:
            root: "myapp"
        # Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
        relationships:

## Multiple databases

You can configure multiple databases, much like [with PostgreSQL](/add-services/postgresql.md#multiple-databases).
To do so, you can use a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
# Complete list of all available properties: https://docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference.html
applications:
  myapp:
    relationships:
      clickhouse-admin: "clickhouse:admin"
      clickhouse-reporter: "clickhouse:reporter"
      clickhouse-importer: "clickhouse:importer"

services:
  clickhouse:
    type: clickhouse:23
    configuration:
      databases:
        - main
        - legacy
      endpoints:
        admin:
          port: 9000 # binary port
          privileges:
            main: admin
            legacy: admin
        reporter:
          default_database: main
          port: 8123 # http port
          privileges:
            main: ro
        importer:
          default_database: legacy
          port: 9000 # binary port
          privileges:
            legacy: rw
```
