## Feature Requests
We love to hear from you! Hereâ€™s how you can submit a feature request:

### If you already have a Platform.sh account

You can open a [support ticket](/learn/overview/get-support.html#create-a-support-ticket) directly from [your Console](https://console.platform.sh/). Describe your needs and our team will take it from there.

### For non-account holders or those who prefer a chat

Join us on our Discord server! We have a dedicated [feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1121795479785721957/1284195722299834510) where you can share your ideas and discuss them with our community and team members.
