{{% description %}}

### Key features

-   **High Availability:** 99.99% SLA (service-level agreement) with [Enterprise or Elite](https://platform.sh/pricing/)
-   **Dedicated hosts:** Each DG3 cluster is provisioned with 3 dedicated hosts as the typical configuration
-   **Headless architecture:** Seamless headless architecture with multi-app support
-   **Self-service:** Customers may edit their application and service YAML files and push changes. Customers can also take advantage of MariaDB Galera multi-leader and adding, upgrading or removing services on their own
-   **Data sync from Dedicated to Grid:** Customers can initiate data syncs themselves via Console (restore a Grid HA backup on DG3 and restore a DG3 backup on a Grid HA environment)
-   **Better containerization:** DG3 is containerized and decouples the base operating system (OS) version and [control plane](/glossary.md#control-plane) from the service versions, so the OS and services can be upgraded independently
-   **Better staging:** Dedicated Gen 3 comes with HA staging as default. This allows the data sync between Dedicated and Grid to be simpler, consistent and seamless

Existing Grid and Dedicated Gen 2 projects cannot be migrated to Dedicated Gen 3.

#### Available services

Your app can connect to each service by referencing the exact same [environment variables](/development/variables.md) as for Grid environments. 

| Service | Supported versions |
| --- | --- |
| **Headless Chrome** | 95 |
| **MariaDB/MySQL** | 10.11 Galera, 10.6 Galera, 10.5 Galera, 10.4 Galera, 10.3 Galera |

| **Vault KMS** | 1.12 |

See the [services documentation](/add-services/_index.md) for service-specific details.

#### Local mounts 

Dedicated Gen 3 provides a redundant infrastructure and local mounts aren’t shared between the three hosts. If you need a folder to be shared between your hosts, such as for common assets, set up a [network storage mount](/add-services/network-storage.md).

### Dedicated Gen 3 vs Dedicated Gen 2

Just like [Dedicated Gen 2](/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/_index.md), Dedicated Gen 3 ensures increased uptime and availability for your apps and services. But as a Dedicated Gen 2 user, you have to go through the Platform.sh Customer Success team to make configuration or application topology changes.

Dedicated Gen 3 gives you both the high availability of Dedicated Gen 2 and the self-service flexibility and features of Grid projects. As a Dedicated Gen 3 user, you can edit your configuration yourself and see those changes reflected in your environments on every push without opening a ticket. See the table below for more differences and similarities between Dedicated Den 3 and Dedicated Gen 2:

#### Optional features

You can enable the following features on your Dedicated Gen 3 projects. To enable an optional feature or get more information on potential fees, [contact Sales](https://platform.sh/contact/).

##### Multiple availability zones 

The default configuration for Dedicated clusters is to launch them into a single availability zone (AZ) for the following reasons:

-   The members of your cluster communicate with each other via TCP to perform DB replication, cache lookup, and other associated tasks. Therefore, the latency between data centers or AZs can become a significant performance liability. When your entire cluster is deployed within a single AZ, the latency between cluster members is minimal. This has a direct effect on perceived end-user performance.
-   Network traffic between AZs is billed, whereas intra-AZ traffic isn’t. Launching Dedicated clusters across multiple AZs leads to higher costs and decreased performance.
If you prefer the peace of mind of hosting across multiple AZs, you can request a different configuration.

{{< note title="Note" theme="info" >}}

Platform.sh is responsible for meeting the 99.99% uptime SLA, so multiple-AZ deployments should only be considered in cases where they’re truly appropriate. Multi-AZ deployments are available only on select AWS regions.

##### SFTP 

In addition to SSH accounts, you can create SFTP accounts with a custom user/password to [transfer files](/development/file-transfer.md). 

{{< note title="Note" theme="info" >}}

On Dedicated Gen 3 projects, SFTP access cannot be limited to a specific directory. Instead, access is given to the whole application directory and its mounts. However, write access is restricted to the mounts declared in your YAML config files. SSH public key based authentication is also supported on the SFTP account.
