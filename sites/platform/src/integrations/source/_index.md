You might want to keep your code in a third-party repository that's linked to your Platform.sh project.
This means you keep all your workflows where you want and use Platform.sh for deploying.

Your Platform.sh project becomes a mirror of your code repository elsewhere.
This means you shouldn't push code directly to Platform.sh.
Any changes you push directly get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in the third-party repository.
