## Using the Fastly CDN plugin
1. In the Upsun [console](https://console.upsun.com), navigate to the project and environment whose metrics you want to view.

      **Note:** To view summarized monthly _project-level_ traffic, including CDN bandwidth and CDN requests, see the **Traffic this month** section of a project page (make sure no environment is selected).

1. On the **Fastly CDN** tab, log in with your Fastly credentials:
    - Service ID
    - API token

      If you have a Fastly subscription, you can get your credentials directly from the Fastly interface.

      If you purchased your Fastly service through Upsun, you can find your credentials in the Upsun project variables or you can get them by [opening a support ticket](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets/open).

      Your Fastly credentials are stored securely within your browser and are never transmitted to Upsun.

After you log in, you can see a dashboard with the following information for the selected environment:
- A real-time metrics tab
- A historical metrics tab, where you can:
  - View metrics by weeks, months, and years by using the date picker.
  - Enable/disable chart metrics by clicking them. Disabled metrics are not shown on the graph.
  - View average, min, and max values for different metrics (when available, these are shown below the historical chart).<BR>

    Both the chart and the table presentation are based on the range you select in the date picker.
