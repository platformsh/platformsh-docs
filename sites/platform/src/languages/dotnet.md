```yaml {configFile="app"}
type: 'dotnet:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
type: 'dotnet:{{% latest "dotnet" %}}'
```

## Building the application

To build basic applications in .NET containers, it's enough to use the [`dotnet publish` command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish)
with the default [framework-dependent deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#publish-framework-dependent):

```yaml {configFile="app"}
hooks:
    build: |
        set -xe
        dotnet publish --output "$PLATFORM_OUTPUT_DIR" \
            -p:UseRazorBuildServer=false \
            -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
```

where `PLATFORM_OUTPUT_DIR` is the output directory for compiled languages available at build time.

Typically, .NET Core builds start a collection of build servers, which are helpful for repeated builds.
On {{% vendor/name %}}, however, if this process isn't disabled,
the build process doesn't finish until the idle timeout is reached.

As a result, you should include `-p` toggles that disable the Razor compiler for dynamic CSHTML pages (`UseRazorBuildServer`)
and the .NET MSBuild compiler (`UseSharedCompilation`).

If you want multiple builds for your application,
make sure to call `dotnet build-server shutdown` at the end of your build hook.

## Running the application

.NET Core applications should be started using the `web.commands.start` directive in `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}`.
This ensures that the command starts at the right moment and stops gracefully when a redeployment needs to be executed.
Also, should the program terminate for any reason, it's automatically restarted.
Note that the start command _must_ run in the foreground.

Incoming requests are passed to the application using either a TCP (default) or Unix socket.
The application must use the [appropriate environment variable](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#where-to-listen) to determine the URI to listen on.
For a TCP socket ([recommended](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=874850)), the application must listen on `http://127.0.0.1`,
using the `PORT` environment variable.

There is an Nginx server sitting in front of your application.
Serving static content via Nginx is recommended, as this allows you to control headers (including cache headers)
and also has marginal performance benefits.

Note that HTTPS is also terminated at the Nginx proxy,
so the `app.UseHttpsRedirection();` line in `Startup.cs` should be removed.
To force HTTPS-only, refer to the [routes documentation](../define-routes/https.md#enable-https).

The following example configures an environment to serve the static content folders commonly found in [ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc) templates using Nginx,
while routing other traffic to the .NET application.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
web:
    locations:
        "/":
            root: "wwwroot"
            allow: true
            passthru: true
            rules:
                # Serve these common asset types with customs cache headers.
                \.(jpe?g|png|gif|svgz?|css|js|map|ico|bmp|eot|woff2?|otf|ttf)$:
                    allow: true
                    expires: 300s
    commands:
        start: "dotnet WebApplication1.dll"
```
You can also route all requests to the application unconditionally:

```yaml {configFile="app"}
web:
    locations:
        "/":
            allow: false
            passthru: true

    commands:
        start: "dotnet WebApplication1.dll"
```
