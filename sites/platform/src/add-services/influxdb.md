It exposes an HTTP API for client interaction. See the [InfluxDB documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb) for more information.

## Deprecated versions

The following versions are still available in your projects,
but they're at their end of life and are no longer receiving security updates from upstream.

| Grid | {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} | {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------------ |
|  {{< image-versions image="influxdb" status="deprecated" environment="grid" >}} | {{< image-versions image="influxdb" status="deprecated" environment="dedicated-gen-3" >}} | {{< image-versions image="influxdb" status="deprecated" environment="dedicated-gen-2" >}} |

To ensure your project remains stable in the future,
switch to a [supported version](#supported-versions).
See more information on [how to upgrade to version 2.3 or later](#upgrade-to-version-23-or-later).

## Usage example

{{% endpoint-description type="influxdb" /%}}

```php
<?php
// This assumes a fictional application with an array named $settings.
if (getenv('PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS')) {
	$relationships = json_decode(base64_decode($relationships), TRUE);

	// For a relationship named 'influxtimedb' referring to one endpoint.
	if (!empty($relationships['influxtimedb'])) {
		foreach ($relationships['influxtimedb'] as $endpoint) {
			$settings['influxdb_host'] = $endpoint['host'];
			$settings['influxdb_port'] = $endpoint['port'];
			break;
		}
	}
}
```

## Export data

To export your data from InfluxDB, follow these steps:

1. Install and set up the [`influx` CLI](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/tools/influx-cli/).
2. Connect to your InfluxDB service with the [{{< vendor/name >}} CLI](../administration/cli/_index.md):

   ```bash
   platform tunnel:single
   ```

   This opens an SSH tunnel to your InfluxDB service on your current environment and produces output like the following:

   ```bash
   SSH tunnel opened to influxdb at: http://127.0.0.1:30000
   ```

3. Get the username, password and token from the [relationship](#relationship-reference) by running the following command:

   ```bash
   platform relationships -P {{<variable "RELATIONSHIP_NAME" >}}
   ```

4. Adapt and run [InfluxDB's CLI export command](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.3/reference/cli/influx/backup/).

    ``` bash
    influx backup --host {{< variable "URL_FROM_STEP_2" >}} --token {{< variable "API_TOKEN_FROM_STEP_3" >}}
    ```

## Upgrade to version 2.3 or later

### From a previous 2.x version

From version 2.3 onward, the structure of relationships changes.

If you're using a prior 2.x version, your app might currently rely on pulling the `bucket`, `org`, `api_token`,
or `user` values available in the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](../development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

If so, to ensure your upgrade is successful, make the following changes to your connection logic:

- Rename the `user` key to `username`.
- Move the `org`, `bucket` and  `api_token` keys so they're contained in a dictionary under the `query` key.

If you're relying on any other attributes connecting to InfluxDB, they remain accessible as top-level keys from the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](../development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables), aside from those addressed above:


```yaml
    {
      "host": "influxdb27.internal",
      "hostname": "3xqrvge7ohuvzhjcityyphqcja.influxdb27.service._.ca-1.platformsh.site",
      "cluster": "jqwcjci6jmwpw-main-bvxea6i",
      "service": "influxdb27",
      "type": "influxdb:2.7",
      "rel": "influxdb",
      "scheme": "http",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "84c601e8b92060c6126a6d3163227ce19e32934a45e19b7cbc0571c2fe9fd347",
      "port": 8086,
      "path": null,
      "query": {
        "org": "main",
        "bucket": "main",
        "api_token": "d85b1219ee8cef8f84d33216257e44d51ddd52e89ae7acbd5ab1d01d320e2f7f"
      },
      "fragment": null,
      "public": false,
      "host_mapped": false,
      "ip": "169.254.99.35"
    }
```

### From a 1.x version

From version 2.3 onward, InfluxDB includes an upgrade utility that can convert databases from previous versions to version 2.3 or later.

To upgrade from a 1.x version to 2.3 or later,
change the service version in your `.platform/services.yaml` file and push your project.
Any existing data you had in your 1.x system is automatically upgraded for you into the 2.3+ system.

{{< note >}}

During an upgrade from a 1.x version to a 2.3 version or later,
a new admin password and a new admin API token are automatically generated.
Previous credentials can't be retained.</br>
You can retrieve your new credentials through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](../development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) or by running `platform relationships`.
