Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform.

It is a framework for storing, reading and analyzing streaming data. See the [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) for more information.

## Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Grid</th>
            <th>Dedicated Gen 3</th>
            <th>Dedicated Gen 2</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>{{< image-versions image="kafka" status="supported" environment="grid" >}}</td>
            <td>{{< image-versions image="kafka" status="supported" environment="dedicated-gen-3" >}}</td>
            <td>{{< image-versions image="kafka" status="supported" environment="dedicated-gen-2" >}}</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Example information available through the [`{{% vendor/prefix %}}_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `{{% vendor/cli %}} relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. 
So your apps should only rely on the `{{% vendor/prefix %}}_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
    "service": "kafka",
    "ip": "123.456.78.90",
    "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.kafka.service._.eu-1.{{< vendor/urlraw "hostname" >}}",
    "cluster": "azertyuiop-main-7rqtwti",
    "host": "kafka.internal",
    "rel": "kafka",
    "scheme": "kafka",
    "type": "kafka:{{< latest "kafka" >}}",
    "port": 9092
}
```

## Usage example

### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `kafka` type:

```yaml {configFile="services"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
    type: kafka:<VERSION>
    disk: 256
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost. 
Back up your data before changing the service.

### 2. Add the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {configFile="apps"}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
    <SERVICE_NAME>: 
```

You can define `<SERVICE_NAME>` as you like, so long as it's unique between all defined services 
and matches in both the application and services configuration.

The example above leverages [default endpoint](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the _name_ of that service.

Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships).

With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship `<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>` and its corresponding [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

### Example configuration

### [Service definition](/add-services.html)

```yaml {configFile="services"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
kafka:
    type: kafka:{{% latest "kafka" %}}
    disk: 256
```

#### [App configuration](/create-apps/_index.md)

```yaml {configFile="apps"}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
    kafka: 
```

### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

## With the ruby-kafka gem

# Producer
require "kafka"
kafka = Kafka.new(["kafka.internal:9092"], client_id: "my-application")
kafka.deliver_message("Hello, World!", topic: "greetings")

# Consumer
kafka.each_message(topic: "greetings") do |message|
  puts message.offset, message.key, message.value
end

The specific way to inject configuration into your application varies. 
Consult your application or framework's documentation.
