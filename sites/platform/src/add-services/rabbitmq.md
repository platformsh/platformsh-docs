[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html) is a message broker
that supports multiple messaging protocols, such as the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
It gives your apps a common platform to send and receive messages
and your messages a safe place to live until they're received.

## Use a framework

If you use one of the following frameworks, follow its guide:

- [Spring](../guides/spring/rabbitmq.md)

## Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Grid</th>
            <th>Dedicated Gen 3</th>
            <th>Dedicated Gen 2</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>{{< image-versions image="rabbitmq" status="supported" environment="grid" >}}</td>
            <td>{{< image-versions image="rabbitmq" status="supported" environment="dedicated-gen-3" >}}</td>
            <td>{{< image-versions image="rabbitmq" status="supported" environment="dedicated-gen-2" >}}</thd>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](/glossary.html#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they aren't receiving security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future,
so migrate to one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions).

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Grid</th>
            <th>Dedicated Gen 3</th>
            <th>Dedicated Gen 2</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>{{< image-versions image="rabbitmq" status="deprecated" environment="grid" >}}</td>
            <td>{{< image-versions image="rabbitmq" status="deprecated" environment="dedicated-gen-3" >}}</td>
            <td>{{< image-versions image="rabbitmq" status="deprecated" environment="dedicated-gen-2" >}}</thd>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Relationship reference 

Example information available through the [`{{% vendor/prefix %}}_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `{{% vendor/cli %}} relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. 
So your apps should only rely on the `{{% vendor/prefix %}}_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": "guest",
  "scheme": "amqp",
  "service": "rabbitmq",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.rabbitmq.service._.eu-1.{{< vendor/urlraw "hostname" >}}",
  "port": 5672,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-afdwftq",
  "host": "rabbitmq.internal",
  "rel": "rabbitmq",
  "path": null,
  "query": [],
  "password": "ChangeMe",
  "type": "rabbitmq:{{% latest "rabbitmq" %}}",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

## Usage example

### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `rabbitmq` type:

```yaml {configFile="services"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
    type: rabbitmq:<VERSION>
    disk: 512
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost. 
Back up your data before changing the service.

### 2. Add the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {configFile="apps"}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
    <SERVICE_NAME>: 
```

You can define `<SERVICE_NAME>` as you like, so long as it's unique between all defined services 
and matches in both the application and services configuration.

The example above leverages [default endpoint](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the _name_ of that service.

Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships).

With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship `<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>` and its corresponding [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

### Example configuration

### [Service definition](/add-services.html)

```yaml {configFile="services"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
rabbitmq:
    type: rabbitmq:{{% latest "rabbitmq" %}}
    disk: 512
```

#### [App configuration](/create-apps)

```yaml {configFile="apps"}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
   rabbitmq: 
```

### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

## Connect to RabbitMQ

When debugging, you may want to connect directly to your RabbitMQ service.
You can connect in multiple ways:

- An [SSH tunnel](#via-ssh)
- A [web interface](#access-the-management-ui)

In each case, you need the login credentials that you can obtain from the [relationship](#relationship-reference).

### Via SSH

To connect directly to your RabbitMQ service in an environment,
open an SSH tunnel with the [{{% vendor/name %}} CLI](../administration/cli/_index.md).

To open an SSH tunnel to your service with port forwarding,
run the following command:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} tunnel:single --gateway-ports
```

Then configure a RabbitMQ client to connect to this tunnel using the credentials from the [relationship](#relationship-reference).
See a [list of RabbitMQ client libraries](https://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html).

### Access the management UI

RabbitMQ offers a [management plugin with a browser-based UI](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html).
You can access this UI with an SSH tunnel.

To open a tunnel, follow these steps.

1.
   a) (On [grid environments](/glossary.md#grid)) SSH into your app container with a flag for local port forwarding:

    ```bash
    ssh $({{% vendor/cli %}} ssh --pipe) -L 15672:{{< variable "RELATIONSHIP_NAME" >}}.internal:15672
    ```

    {{< variable "RELATIONSHIP_NAME" >}} is the [name you defined](#2-add-the-relationship).

   b) (On [dedicated environments](/glossary.html#dedicated-gen-2)) SSH into your cluster with a flag for local port forwarding:

    ```bash
    ssh $({{% vendor/cli %}} ssh --pipe) -L 15672:localhost:15672
    ```

2.  Open `http://localhost:15672` in your browser.
    Log in using the username and password from the [relationship](#relationship-reference).

## Configuration options

You can configure your RabbitMQ service in the [services configuration](#1-configure-the-service) with the following options:

| Name     | Type              | Required | Description                                          |
|----------|-------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `vhosts` | List of `string`s | No       | Virtual hosts used for logically grouping resources. |

You can configure additional [virtual hosts](https://www.rabbitmq.com/vhosts.html),
which can be useful for separating resources, such as exchanges, queues, and bindings, into their own namespaces.
To create virtual hosts, add them to your configuration as in the following example:

```yaml {configFile="services"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
rabbitmq:
    type: "rabbitmq:{{% latest "rabbitmq" %}}"
    disk: 512
    configuration:
        vhosts:
            - host1
            - host2
```

## Upgrading

When upgrading RabbitMQ, skipping major versions (e.g. 3.7 -> 3.11) [is not supported](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html#rabbitmq-version-upgradability).
Make sure you upgrade sequentially (3.7 -> 3.8 -> 3.9 -> 3.10 -> 3.11) and that each upgrade commit translates into an actual deployment.
