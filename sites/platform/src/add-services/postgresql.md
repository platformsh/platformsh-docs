## Access the service directly

Access the service using the Platform CLI by running `platform sql`.

You can also access it from your app container via [SSH](../development/ssh/_index.md).
From your [relationship data](#relationship-reference), you need: `username`, `host`, and `port`.
Then run the following command:

```bash
psql -U {{< variable "USERNAME" >}} -h {{< variable "HOST" >}} -p {{< variable "PORT" >}}
```

Using the values from the [example](#relationship-reference), that would be:

```bash
psql -U main -h postgresql.internal -p 5432
```

{{% service-values-change %}}

## Exporting data

The easiest way to download all data in a PostgreSQL instance is with the Platform CLI. If you have a single SQL database, the following command exports all data using the `pg_dump` command to a local file:

```bash
platform db:dump
```

If you have multiple SQL databases it prompts you which one to export. You can also specify one by relationship name explicitly:

```bash
platform db:dump --relationship database
```

By default the file is uncompressed. If you want to compress it, use the `--gzip` (`-z`) option:

```bash
platform db:dump --gzip
```

You can use the `--stdout` option to pipe the result to another command. For example, if you want to create a bzip2-compressed file, you can run:

```bash
platform db:dump --stdout | bzip2 > dump.sql.bz2
```

## Importing data

Make sure that the imported file contains objects with cleared ownership and `IF EXISTS` clauses. For example, you can create a DB dump with following parameters:

```bash
pg_dump --no-owner --clean --if-exists
```

The easiest way to load data into a database is to pipe an SQL dump through the `platform sql` command, like so:

```bash
platform sql < my_database_backup.sql
```

That runs the database backup against the SQL database on {{< vendor/name >}}.
That works for any SQL file, so the usual caveats about importing an SQL dump apply
(for example, it's best to run against an empty database).
As with exporting, you can also specify a specific environment to use and a specific database relationship to use, if there are multiple.

```bash
platform sql --relationship database -e {{< variable "BRANCH_NAME" >}} < my_database_backup.sql
```

{{< note >}}
Importing a database backup is a destructive operation. It overwrites data already in your database.
Taking a backup or a database export before doing so is strongly recommended.
{{< /note >}}

## Sanitizing data

To ensure people who review code changes can't access personally identifiable information stored in your database,
[sanitize your development environments](../development/sanitize-db/postgresql.md).

## Multiple databases

If you are using version `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, or later of this service,
it's possible to define multiple databases as well as multiple users with different permissions.
To do so requires defining multiple endpoints.
Under the `configuration` key of your service there are two additional keys:

* `databases`:  This is a YAML array listing the databases that should be created. If not specified, a single database named `main` is created.

  Note that removing a schema from the list of `schemas` on further deployments results in **the deletion of the schema.**
* `endpoints`: This is a nested YAML object defining different credentials. Each endpoint may have access to one or more schemas (databases), and may have different levels of permission for each. The valid permission levels are:
  * `ro`: Using this endpoint only `SELECT` queries are allowed.
  * `rw`: Using this endpoint `SELECT` queries as well as `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` queries are allowed.
  * `admin`: Using this endpoint all queries are allowed, including DDL queries (`CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, etc.).

Consider the following illustrative example:

```yaml
dbpostgres:
    type: postgresql:13
    disk: 2048
    configuration:
        databases:
            - main
            - legacy
        endpoints:
            admin:
                privileges:
                    main: admin
                    legacy: admin
            reporter:
                default_database: main
                privileges:
                    main: ro
            importer:
                default_database: legacy
                privileges:
                    legacy: rw
```

This example creates a single PostgreSQL service named `dbpostgres`. The server has two databases, `main` and `legacy` with three endpoints created.

* `admin`: has full access to both databases.
* `reporter`: has `SELECT` query access to the `main` database, but no access to `legacy`.
* `importer`: has `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` access (but not DDL access) to the `legacy` database. It doesn't have access to `main`.

If a given endpoint has access to multiple databases you should also specify which is listed by default in the relationships array. If one isn't specified, the `path` property of the relationship is `null`. While that may be acceptable for an application that knows the name of the database it's connecting to, automated tools like the {{< vendor/name >}} CLI can't access the database on that relationship. For that reason, defining the `default_database` property is always recommended.

Once these endpoints are defined, you need to expose them to your application as a relationship. Continuing with the above example, your `relationships` in `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` might look like:

```yaml
relationships:
    database: "dbpostgres:admin"
    reports: "dbpostgres:reporter"
    imports: "dbpostgres:importer"
```

Each database is accessible to your application through the `database`, `reports`, and `imports` relationships. They'll be available in the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable and all have the same structure documented above, but with different credentials. You can use those to connect to the appropriate database with the specified restrictions using whatever the SQL access tools are for your language and application.

A service configuration without the `configuration` block defined is equivalent to the following default values:

```yaml
configuration:
    databases:
        - main
    endpoints:
        postgresql:
          default_database: main
          privileges:
            main: admin
```

If you do not define `database` but `endpoints` are defined, then the single database `main` is created with the following assumed configuration:

```yaml
configuration:
    databases:
        - main
    endpoints: <your configuration>
```

Alternatively, if you define multiple databases but no endpoints, a single user `main` is created with `admin` access to each of your databases, equivalent to the configuration below:

```yaml
configuration:
    databases:
        - firstdb
        - seconddb
        - thirddb
    endpoints:
        main:
            firstdb: admin
            seconddb: admin
            thirddb: admin
```

## Service timezone

To change the timezone for the current session, run `SET TIME ZONE {{< variable "TIMEZONE" >}};`.

## Extensions

{{< vendor/name >}} supports a number of PostgreSQL extensions. To enable them, list them under the `configuration.extensions` key in your `{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}` file, like so:

```yaml
db:
    type: postgresql:12
    disk: 1025
    configuration:
        extensions:
            - pg_trgm
            - hstore
```

In this case, you have `pg_trgm` installed, providing functions to determine the similarity of text based on trigram matching, and `hstore` providing a key-value store.

{{< note >}}

You can't upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with the `postgis` extension enabled.
For more details, see how to [upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with `postgis`](#upgrade-to-postgresql-12-with-the-postgis-extension).

{{< /note >}}

## Notes

### Could not find driver

If you see this error: `Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'could not find driver'`, this means you are missing the `pdo_pgsql` PHP extension. You need to enable it in your `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` (see above).

## Upgrading

PostgreSQL 10 and later include an upgrade utility that can convert databases from previous versions to version 10 or later. If you upgrade your service from a previous version of PostgreSQL to version 10 or above (by modifying the `{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}` file), it upgrades automatically.

The utility can't upgrade PostgreSQL 9 versions, so upgrades from PostgreSQL 9.3 to 9.6 aren't supported. Upgrade straight to version 11 instead.

{{< note theme="warning" >}}

Make sure you first test your migration on a separate branch.
{{< /note >}}

{{< note theme="warning" >}}

Be sure to take a backup of your production environment **before** you merge this change.
{{< /note >}}

Downgrading isn't supported. If you want, for whatever reason, to downgrade you should dump to SQL, remove the service, recreate the service, and import your dump.

### Upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with the `postgis` extension

You can't upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with the `postgis` extension enabled.
It involves a change to a major version that results in a failed deployment that requires support intervention to fix.
Upgrading from 12 to a higher version is possible.

If you need to upgrade to version 12, follow the same steps recommended for downgrading:

1. Dump the database.
2. Remove the service.
3. Create a new service with PostgreSQL 12.
4. Import the dump to that service.
