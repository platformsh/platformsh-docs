## Lock wait timeout

If a process running in your application acquired a lock from MySQL for a long period of time,
you receive MySQL error messages like this:

```sql
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1205 Lock wait timeout exceeded;
```

This is typically caused by one of the following:

* There are multiple places acquiring locks in different order.
  For example, code path 1 first locks record A and then locks record B,
  while code path 2 first locks record B and then locks record A.
* There is a long running background process executed by your application that holds the lock until it ends.

If you're using [MariaDB 10+](./_index.md), use the SQL query `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST \G` to list DB queries waiting for locks.
To determine where to debug, find output like the following:

```sql
< skipped >
Command: Query
Time: ...
State: Waiting for table metadata lock
Info: SELECT ...
< skipped >
```

To find active background processes, run `ps aufx` on your application container.

Make sure that locks are acquired in a pre-defined order and released as soon as possible.

## Definer/invoker of view lack rights to use them

There is a single MySQL user, so you can not use "DEFINER" Access Control mechanism for Stored Programs and Views.

When creating a `VIEW`, you may need to explicitly set the `SECURITY` parameter to `INVOKER`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SQL SECURITY INVOKER
VIEW `view_name` AS
SELECT
```

## Server has gone away

### Disk space issues

Errors such as `PDO Exception 'MySQL server has gone away'` are usually the result of exhausting your available disk space.
Get an estimate of current disk usage using the CLI command `{{% vendor/cli %}} db:size`.
Just keep in mind it's an estimate and not exact.

Allocate more space to the service in [`{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}`](../_index.md).
As table space can grow rapidly,
it's usually advisable to make your database mount size twice the size reported by the `db:size` command.

You may want to add a [low-disk warning](../../integrations/notifications.md#low-disk-warning)
to learn about low disk space before it becomes an issue.

### Packet size limitations

`MySQL server has gone away` errors may be caused by the size of the database packets.
If so, the logs may show warnings like `Error while sending QUERY packet` before the error.

One way to resolve the issue is to use the [`max_allowed_packet` parameter](./_index.md#configure-the-database).

### Worker timeout

`MySQL server has gone away` errors may be caused by server timeouts.
MySQL has a built-in timeout for idle connections, which defaults to 10 minutes.
Most typical web connections end long before that's ever approached,
but a long-running worker may idle and not need the database for longer than the timeout, leading to a "server has gone away" message.

The best approach is to wrap your connection logic in code that detects a "server has gone away" exception
and tries to re-establish the connection.

Alternatively, if your worker is idle for too long it can self-terminate.
{{% vendor/name %}} automatically restarts the worker process and the new process can establish a new database connection.

## Too many connections

You may get the following [error message](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/e1040/): `Error 1040: Too many connections`.
A common way to solve this issue is to increase the `max_connections` property in your MariaDB service configuration.
However, on {{% vendor/name %}}, you **cannot** configure `max_connections` directly.

### Quick fix

{{% note theme="info"%}}
This information applies to DG3 and Professional/Grid {{% vendor/name %}} projects.</br>
For DG2 projects, [contact Support](/learn/overview/get-support.md) to configure the `max_connections` property.
{{% /note %}}

You cannot configure `max_connections` directly in {{% vendor/name %}} service configurations. 
However, to solve `Error 1040`, you can increase `max_connections` indirectly.

For example, in the following service configuration for MariaDB, `max_connections` is `188` as [set by {{% vendor/name %}}](#how-it-works):

```yaml {configFile="services"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
mariadb:
    type: mariadb:{{% latest "mariadb" %}}
    disk: 2048
    size: L
    configuration:
        properties:
            max_allowed_packet: 16
```

To **increase** `max_connections`, you can **either**:

- **decrease** `max_allowed_packet` (for example, `16` → `15` results in `max_connections=201`)
- or **increase** `size` (for example, `L` → `XL` results in `max_connections=356`)

### How it works

Behind the scenes, `max_connections` (for Professional and DG3 projects) is calculated from values that you _can_ change:

1. **`max_allowed_packet`**: `max_allowed_packet` is [directly configurable](/add-services/mysql#configure-the-database)
   in your `.platform/services.yaml` file with an integer value. 
   The default value of `16` is shown below to illustrate:

   ```yaml {configFile="services"}
   # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
   mariadb:
       type: mariadb:{{% latest "mariadb" %}}
           disk: 2048
           configuration:
               properties:
                   max_allowed_packet: 16
    ```

1. **The memory available to the service**: Resources are distributed across the containers
   in a cluster based on your {{% vendor/name %}} [plan size](/administration/pricing/_index.md).
   The _strategy_ for how resources are distributed can either be determined for you by {{% vendor/name %}} (equivalent to setting `size: AUTO`) or by setting a container size explicitly:

    ```yaml {configFile="services"}
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    mariadb:
        type: mariadb:{{% latest "mariadb" %}}
        disk: 2048
        size: L
        configuration:
            properties:
                max_allowed_packet: 16
    ```

    The memory for a given container from its `size` depends on its [container profile***](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#container-profiles-cpu-and-memory).

    For example, [MariaDB](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#container-profile-reference) has a `HIGH_MEMORY` [container profile](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#high_memory-container-profile).
    For `size: L`, it means 0.40 CPU and 1280 MB of memory.

If we assume the configuration above, where:

- `mariadb.size: L`, which we know is 1280 MB, referred to below as `application_size`
- `mariadb.configuration.properties.max_allowed_packet: 16`

`max_allowed_packet` is `188`, which is determined by {{% vendor/name %}} according to: 

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{max_connections} = \text{int}\Biggl[ \min \left( \frac{\texttt{FREE_MEMORY}}{\texttt{max_allowed_packet}}, 500 \right) \Biggr]
\end{aligned}

This calculation uses three additional calculations:

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{FREE_MEMORY} = \texttt{AVAILABLE_MEMORY} - \left( 50 + \texttt{innodb_buffer_pool_size} \right) \newline \newline
\texttt{AVAILABLE_MEMORY} = (\texttt{application_size} * 2) + 512 \newline \newline
\texttt{innodb_buffer_pool_size} = \frac{\text{int}\left( 0.75 \cdot \texttt{application_size} \right)}{1024^{2}}
\end{aligned}

So for our current example, where:

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{application_size} = 1280 \newline
\texttt{max_allowed_packet} = 16
\end{aligned}

You get:

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{innodb_buffer_pool_size} = \frac{\text{int}\left( 0.75 \cdot \texttt{application_size} \right)}{1024^{2}} = \frac{\text{int}\left( 0.75 \cdot \texttt{1280} \right)}{1024^{2}} \approx 9.155 \times 10^{-4}
\end{aligned}

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{AVAILABLE_MEMORY} = (\texttt{application_size} * 2) + 512 = (1280 * 2) + 512 = 3072
\end{aligned}

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{FREE_MEMORY} = \texttt{AVAILABLE_MEMORY} - \left( 50 + \texttt{innodb_buffer_pool_size} \right) \newline \newline
\texttt{FREE_MEMORY} = 3072 - \left( 50 + 0.0009155... \right) = 3021.999084
\end{aligned}

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{max_connections} = \text{int}\Biggl[ \min \left( \frac{\texttt{FREE_MEMORY}}{\texttt{max_allowed_packet}}, 500 \right) \Biggr] = \text{int}\Biggl[ \min \left( \frac{3021.999084}{16}, 500 \right) \Biggr] = \text{int}\Biggl[ 188.87... \Biggr]
\end{aligned}

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{max_connections} = 188
\end{aligned}

The following table provides additional example calculations of `max_connections` for all `size` settings
and for a number of `max_allow_packet` settings.

{{% note%}}
The maximum value for `max_connections` is 500, indicated with italicized integers in the table.

Also, you can **increase** `max_connections` in your environments by either:

- **decreasing** the `max_allow_packet` value in your service configuration
- or **increasing** your plan `size`
