## Supported versions

Elasticsearch is now a premium service.
This means that from version 7.11 onwards, you need to add Elasticsearch to your project at an additional cost.
To do so, contact [Sales](https://platform.sh/contact/).

The following premium versions are supported:

| Grid | {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} | {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------------ |
|  {{< image-versions image="elasticsearch" status="supported" environment="grid" >}} | {{< image-versions image="elasticsearch" status="supported" environment="dedicated-gen-3" >}} | {{< image-versions image="elasticsearch" status="supported" environment="dedicated-gen-2" >}} |

{{% major-minor-versions-note configMinor="true" %}}

## Deprecated versions

The following versions are still available in your projects for free,
but they're at their end of life and are no longer receiving security updates from upstream.

| Grid | {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} | {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------------ |
|  {{< image-versions image="elasticsearch" status="deprecated" environment="grid" >}} | {{< image-versions image="elasticsearch" status="deprecated" environment="dedicated-gen-3" >}} | {{< image-versions image="elasticsearch" status="deprecated" environment="dedicated-gen-2" >}} |

To ensure your project remains stable in the future,
switch to [a premium version](#supported-versions).

Alternatively, you can switch to one of the latest, free versions of [OpenSearch](./opensearch.md).
To do so, follow the same procedure as for [upgrading](#upgrading).

For [premium versions](#supported-versions),
the service type is `elasticsearch-enterprise`.

## Usage example

{{< note >}}

When you create an index on Elasticsearch,
don't specify the `number_of_shards` or `number_of_replicas` settings in your Elasticsearch API call.
These values are set automatically based on available resources.

## Authentication

By default, Elasticsearch has no authentication.
No username or password is required to connect to it.

Starting with Elasticsearch 7.2 you may optionally enable HTTP Basic authentication.
To do so, include the following in your `services.yaml` configuration:

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
search:
    type: elasticsearch:7.2
    disk: 2048
    configuration:
        authentication:
            enabled: true
```

If you're using a [premium version](#supported-versions),
use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type.

That enables mandatory HTTP Basic auth on all requests.
The credentials are available in any relationships that point at that service,
in the `username` and `password` properties.
{{% service-values-change %}}

This functionality is generally not required if Elasticsearch isn't exposed on its own public HTTP route.
However, certain applications may require it, or it allows you to safely expose Elasticsearch directly to the web.
To do so, add a route to `routes.yaml` that has `search:elasticsearch` as its upstream
(where `search` is whatever you named the service in `services.yaml`).
For example:

```yaml {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://es.{default}":
    type: upstream
    upstream: search:elasticsearch
```

## Plugins

Elasticsearch offers a number of plugins.
To enable them, list them under the `configuration.plugins` key in your `services.yaml` file, like so:

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
search:
    type: "elasticsearch:7.2"
    disk: 1024
    configuration:
        plugins:
            - analysis-icu
            - lang-python
```

If you're using a [premium version](#supported-versions),
use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type.

In this example you'd have the ICU analysis plugin and Python script support plugin.

If there is a publicly available plugin you need that isn't listed here, [contact support](../overview/get-support.md).

### Plugin removal

Removing plugins previously added in your `services.yaml` file doesn't automatically uninstall them from your Elasticsearch instances.
This is deliberate, as removing a plugin may result in data loss or corruption of existing data that relied on that plugin.
Removing a plugin usually requires reindexing.

To permanently remove a previously enabled plugin,
[upgrade the service](#upgrading) to create a new instance of Elasticsearch and migrate to it.
In most cases it isn't necessary as an unused plugin has no appreciable impact on the server.

## Upgrading

The Elasticsearch data format sometimes changes between versions in incompatible ways.
Elasticsearch doesn't include a data upgrade mechanism as it's expected that all indexes can be regenerated from stable data if needed.
To upgrade (or downgrade) Elasticsearch, use a new service from scratch.

There are two ways to do so.

### Destructive

In your `services.yaml` file, change the version *and* name of your Elasticsearch service.
Then update the name in the `.platform.app.yaml` relationships block.

When you push that to Platform.sh, the old service is deleted and a new one with the new name is created with no data.
You can then have your application reindex data as appropriate.

This approach has the downsides of temporarily having an empty Elasticsearch instance,
which your application may or may not handle gracefully, and needing to rebuild your index afterward.
Depending on the size of your data that could take a while.

### Transitional

With a transitional approach, you temporarily have two Elasticsearch services.
Add a second Elasticsearch service with the new version a new name and give it a new relationship in `.platform.app.yaml`.
You can optionally run in that configuration for a while to allow your application to populate indexes in the new service as well.

Once you're ready to switch over, remove the old Elasticsearch service and relationship.
You may optionally have the new Elasticsearch service use the old relationship name if that's easier for your app to handle.
Your application is now using the new Elasticsearch service.

This approach has the benefit of never being without a working Elasticsearch instance.
On the downside, it requires two running Elasticsearch servers temporarily,
each of which consumes resources and needs adequate disk space.
Depending on the size of your data, that may be a lot of disk space.
