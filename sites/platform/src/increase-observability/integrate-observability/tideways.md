## Get Started

### 1. Get your license key

Sign up at [Tideways](https://app.tideways.io/register/) and get your license key.

### 2. Add your license key

Add your Tideways license key as a project level variable:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} variable:create --visible-build false php:tideways.api_key --value '<your-license-key>'
```

### 3. Enable the Tideways extension

Enable the Tideways extension in your `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` as follows:

```yaml
runtime:
    extensions:
        - tideways
```

Enabling the extension also activates the Tideways background process.

Push the changes to your {{% vendor/name %}} environment to enable Tideways as follows:

```bash
git add {{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}
git commit -m "Enable Tideways."
git push
```

Tideways should now be enabled.
Give it a few hours to a day to get a decent set of data before checking your Tideways dashboard.

## Deployment Integration

Tideways integrates with {{% vendor/name %}} deployment hooks and provides performance comparisons
before and after deployments were released. You can find the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI command to register
this hook for your application in Tideways "Application Settings" screen under the section
"Exports & Integrations". Here is an example:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} integration:add --type=webhook --url="https://app.tideways.io/api/events/external/1234/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"
```
