## Set up Blackfire

### On a Grid or {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} infrastructure

If you're using a plan with the [Observability Suite](https://platform.sh/features/observability-suite/),
the [Blackfire automated integration](#automated-integration) is enabled on your environments by default.
Note that as an Observability Suite user, you can only access your Blackfire environments
after you've been granted access to the related {{% vendor/name %}} project.
Therefore, to access your Blackfire environments, make sure you log in using your {{% vendor/name %}} account.

If you have a {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} cluster or Grid environments without the Observability suite,
you need to enable the integration yourself.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a [Blackfire account](https://blackfire.io/signup?target=/login), preferably using your {{% vendor/name %}} login.
2. In your Blackfire account, create an organization.
   If you subscribed to Blackfire independently, your organization is automatically activated.
   If you subscribed to Blackfire through {{% vendor/name %}},
   [ask **{{% vendor/name %}}** Support](https://console.platform.sh/-/users/~/tickets/open) to activate your organization.
3. In your organization, create an environment.
4. In your environment, click **Settings/Environment Credentials**.
5. Retrieve your Blackfire server ID and server token.
6. Follow [the instructions from the Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/paas/platformsh).

If you're using the [Managed Fastly CDN](../../domains/cdn/managed-fastly.md),
it's already configured to operate with Blackfire.
If you're using a different [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](../../domains/cdn/_index.md),
make sure you [configure it](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/proxies/index)
to let Blackfire profile the code running on your servers.

### On {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} infrastructure

To install Blackfire on your {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} environments:

1. Create a [Blackfire account](https://blackfire.io/signup?target=/login), preferably using your {{% vendor/name %}} login.
2. In your Blackfire account, create an organization.
   If you subscribed to Blackfire independently, your organization is automatically activated.
   If you subscribed to Blackfire through {{% vendor/name %}},
   [ask **{{% vendor/name %}}** Support](https://console.platform.sh/-/users/~/tickets/open) to activate your organization.
3. In your organization, create an environment.
4. In your environment, click **Settings/Environment Credentials**.
5. Retrieve your Blackfire server ID and server token.
6. Send those credentials to [Support](https://console.platform.sh/-/users/~/tickets/open) so they complete the installation.

If you're using the [Managed Fastly CDN](../../domains/cdn/managed-fastly.md),
it's already configured to operate with Blackfire.
If you're using a different [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](../../domains/cdn/_index.md),
make sure you [configure it](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/proxies/index)
to let Blackfire profile the code running on your servers.

### Automated integration

{{< partial "observability-suite/body.md" >}}

The Blackfire automated integration is available for Grid and {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} environments.

When you create a new environment,
it automatically triggers the creation of a Blackfire environment with the same settings.
On this Blackfire environment, you have access to [all the features provided by Blackfire](https://www.blackfire.io/features/).
This includes monitoring, profiling, alerting, and build-related features.

When a Blackfire environment is created based on a Grid environment,
user access settings are replicated from the {{% vendor/name %}} Console to Blackfire.

This includes all [access levels](https://blackfire.io/docs/up-and-running/access-management).

To access the Blackfire environment, each project user needs a Blackfire account.
When a project user doesn't already have a Blackfire account,
a new one is automatically created using the user's {{% vendor/name %}} credentials.

You might have Blackfire variables already set on your project.
In this case, the existing variables override the settings of the automated integration.

Note that to trigger the synchronization of changes to users and their access levels,
you need to redeploy the environment.

## Get started with Blackfire Monitoring

Once Blackfire is [set up on your infrastructure](#set-up-blackfire),
to start monitoring your environment follow these steps:

### 1. Activate Blackfire Monitoring

If you want to monitor a PHP or Python app, Blackfire Monitoring is available by default on your environments.
You only need to [specify which environments](#2-enable-blackfire-monitoring-on-your-environments) you want to monitor.

You can override the default behavior and deactivate Blackfire Monitoring by setting a `env:BLACKFIRE_APM_ENABLED`
[environment variable](../../development/variables/set-variables.md#create-environment-specific-variables) with a value of `0`.

To do so, create the following :

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} variable:create --level environment --prefix env: --name BLACKFIRE_APM_ENABLED --value 0
```

### 2. Enable Blackfire Monitoring on your environments

To enable Blackfire Monitoring on your environments, follow these steps:

1.  Go to your [organizations list](https://blackfire.io/my/organizations)
    and select the organization where you want to enable Blackfire monitoring.

2.  Click **Organization Monitoring Usage**.

    ![A screenshot of where to find Organization Monitoring Usage](/images/integrations/blackfire/blackfire-organization-monitoring.png "0.40")

3.  In the **Monitoring Activation** section,
    enable monitoring on the environments of your choice.

    ![A screenshot of what's seen in Monitoring Activation](/images/integrations/blackfire/blackfire-monitoring-activation.png "0.40")

For more information on Blackfire monitoring features,
see the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/monitoring-cookbooks/index).

## Blackfire Profiling

While your code is running, the Blackfire profiler collects deep performance metrics
and provides full details and context of your code's behavior.
This helps you find the root cause of performance bottlenecks.

Blackfire lets you profile your application anywhere it's deployed,
including on your local development machines.
Using a browser extension or CLI command,
you can profile HTTP requests, CLI scripts, Consumers, and Daemons.

For more information on Blackfire profiling features,
see the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/profiling-cookbooks/index).

## Test the performance of each new deployment

Blackfire's native integration with {{% vendor/name %}} enables you to test your app's performance
every time you deploy a branch in production, staging, or development.
Follow these steps:

1.  Set up the [Blackfire Builds integration](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/paas/platformsh#builds-level-production).

2.  Optional: set up an [integration with your Git provider](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/git/index)
    and get commit status updates from build reports.

3.  To test business-critical use cases, [write scenarios](https://blackfire.io/docs/builds-cookbooks/scenarios).

## Troubleshooting

### Bypass your reverse proxy, load balancer or CDN

To use [Blackfire profiling](#blackfire-profiling),
you need to bypass any reverse proxy, load balancer or [CDN](../../domains/cdn/_index.md) that sits in front of your app.
See [how to configure a bypass](https://blackfire.io/docs/reference-guide/reverse-proxies#documentation).

### Configure your HTTP cache

To take advantage of Blackfire features while using the HTTP cache with cookies,
allow the `__blackfire` cookie to go through the cache.

To do so, add [a configuration](../../define-routes/cache.md#allowing-only-specific-cookies) similar to the following:

```yaml {configFile="routes"}
cache:
    enabled: true
    cookies: ["/SESS.*/", "__blackfire"]
```

## Get support

If you're experiencing issues with Blackfire and [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) information doesn't help,
follow these steps:

1. Retrieve [startup errors](#1-retrieve-startup-errors).
2. Retrieve your [Blackfire logs](#2-retrieve-your-blackfire-logs).
3. Send this data to [Blackfire Support](https://support.blackfire.io).

### 1. Retrieve startup errors

To retrieve startup errors, run the following command:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} ssh -- php -d display_startup_errors=on --ri blackfire
```

### 2. Retrieve your Blackfire logs

To retrieve your Blackfire logs, follow these steps:

1.  On the environment where you're facing issues, create the following [variable](../../development/variables/set-variables.md):

    ```bash
    {{% vendor/cli %}} variable:create php:blackfire.log_file --value /tmp/blackfire.log
    ```

2.  To set the verbosity of the logs to level 4 (debug level), create the following variable:

    ```bash
    {{% vendor/cli %}} variable:create php:blackfire.log_level --value 4
    ```

3.  Start a profile or build.

4.  To display the logs, run the following command:

    ```bash
    {{% vendor/cli %}} ssh -- cat /tmp/blackfire.log > blackfire.log
    ```

After you've retrieved the logs, you can disable them.
To do so, run the following commands:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} variable:delete php:blackfire.log_file
{{% vendor/cli %}} variable:delete php:blackfire.log_level
```
