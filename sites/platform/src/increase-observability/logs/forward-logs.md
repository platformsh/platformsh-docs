You might use a service to analyze logs from various parts of your fleet.
You might want to consolidate all your logs in one place that everyone has access to
without needing to grant them access to each project individually.

In such cases, forward your logs from {{% vendor/name %}} and Blackfire to a third-party service.
You can use a [service with an integration](#use-a-log-forwarding-integration)
or any service that supports a [syslog endpoint](#forward-to-a-syslog-endpoint) or [HTTP endpoint](#forward-to-an-http-endpoint).


{{% version/specific %}}
Log forwarding is available for Grid and {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} projects.
For {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} projects, see how to [log remotely with `rsyslog`](../../dedicated-gen-2/architecture/options.md#remote-logging).
<--->
{{% /version/specific %}}
Logs to `stdout` and `stderr` are forwarded.
Logs in files can't be forwarded.

To enable log forwarding in a project, you need to be a [project admin](../../administration/users.md).
You also need your project to have the capability for log forwarding.

## Use a log forwarding integration

Certain services have a specific integration for forwarding logs.
If your third-party service isn't supported, you can forward to a [syslog endpoint](#forward-to-a-syslog-endpoint).

### Integrated third-party services

Integrations exist for the following third-party services to enable log forwarding:

- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)
- [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/)
- [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/)

### Enable a log forwarding integration

#### Using the CLI 

To enable log forwarding for a specific project using the [{{% vendor/name %}} CLI](../../administration/cli/_index.md),
follow the steps for your selected service.

{{< codetabs >}}
+++
title=New Relic
+++

1. Get an API key from New Relic.
   You need a [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key).
   Your New Relic organization likely has one, but you can create one by following the New Relic docs.
2. Choose an API endpoint.
   You can use the U.S. endpoint `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1`
   or the EU endpoint `https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1`.
3. Create the integration with the following command:

   ```bash
   {{% vendor/cli %}} integration:add --type newrelic --url {{< variable "API_ENDPOINT" >}} --license-key {{% variable "LICENSE_KEY" %}}
   ```

View your logs in the **Logs** dashboard.

title=Splunk
+++

1. In Splunk, get an Event Collector token on [Splunk Platform](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Create_an_Event_Collector_token_on_Splunk_Cloud_Platform)
   or [Splunk Enterprise](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Create_an_Event_Collector_token_on_Splunk_Enterprise).
2. Determine your host, which is the Splunk instance that's collecting data.
3. Choose an index name.
4. Create the integration with the following command:

   ```bash
   {{% vendor/cli %}} integration:add --type splunk --url https://http-inputs.{{< variable "HOST" >}}.splunkcloud.com/services/collector/event --index {{< variable "INDEX" >}} --token {{< variable "TOKEN" >}}
   ```

View your logs in the **Apps->Search & Reporting** dashboard.
Filter by the index name to find the relevant events.

<--->

title=Sumo Logic
+++

1. In Sumo Logic, [configure an HTTP source](https://help-opensource.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics/#configure-an-httplogs-and-metrics-source).
   Make sure to copy the Source Category and collector URL.
2. Create the integration with the following command:

   ```bash
   {{% vendor/cli %}} integration:add --type sumologic --url {{< variable "COLLECTOR_URL" >}} --category {{< variable "SOURCE_CATEGORY" >}}
   ```

View your logs in the **Log Search** tab.

{{< /codetabs >}}

To start forwarding logs, [trigger a redeploy](../../development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project.
2. Click {{< icon settings >}} **Settings**.
3. Click **Integrations**.
4. Click **Add Integration**.
5. Select the integration you want to enable.
6. In the **Configure your integration** window,
   specify your configuration options.
7. Click **Add Integration**.
   The new integration overview is displayed,
   and you can view your logs in the **Activity** section.

## Forward to a syslog endpoint

Syslog is a standard protocol for transferring log messages.
Many third-party services offer endpoints for ingesting syslog events.
You can forward your {{% vendor/name %}} and Blackfire logs to any of those endpoints.

{{< codetabs >}}
+++
title=Using the CLI
+++

To enable log forwarding to a syslog endpoint, 
run a command similar to the following:

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} integration:add --type syslog --syslog-host {{< variable "INGESTION_HOST" >}} --syslog-port {{< variable "INGESTION_HOST_PORT" >}}
```

`type`, `syslog-host`, and `syslog-port` are the only properties required for all endpoints.
The following table shows the other available properties:

| Property         | Type      | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth-token`     | `string`  |            | The token to authenticate with the given service.                                                                                                     |
| `auth-mode`      | `string`  | `prefix`   | The mode for authentication with the given service. Can be `prefix` or `structured_data`. Defaults to `prefix`.                                       |
| `facility`       | `string`  | `1` (user) | A [syslog facility code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Facility) to attach with each log to identify the source. Can be a number from 0 to 23. |
| `message-format` | `string`  | `rfc5424`  | The standard to use for the message format. Can be `rfc5424` or `rfc3164`.                                                                            |
| `protocol`       | `string`  | `tls`      | The network protocol to use in the connection. Can be one of `tls`, `tcp`, or `udp`. Defaults to `tls`.                                               |
| `verify-tls`     | `boolean` | `true`     | Whether to verify Transport Layer Security (TLS) certification when using the TLS protocol.                                                           |

To include a property, add it as a flag, for example `--protocol tcp`.
This should let you connect to any service that has syslog endpoints.

To start forwarding logs, once you've added the service [trigger a redeploy](../../development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

## Forward to an HTTP endpoint

Some third-party services, such as [Elasticsearch](../../add-services/elasticsearch.md) and [OpenSearch](../../add-services/opensearch.md),
support ingesting log messages through an HTTP endpoint.
You can use HTTP forwarding to forward {{% vendor/name %}}and Blackfire logs to such third-party services.

HTTP forwarding makes a `POST` HTTP request with an `application/json` body while forwarding the log messages to the endpoint.

As an example, to forward logs to Elasticsearch using HTTP log forwarding, run the following command:

```
{{% vendor/cli %}} integration:add --type httplog --url "https://{{< variable "ELASTICSEARCH_URL" >}}/{{< variable "INDEX_NAME" >}}/_doc" --header "Authorization: Basic <basic_auth_token>" --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

`type` and `url` are the only properties required for all endpoints.
Optionally, you can use the `headers` property to pass additional headers in the HTTP requests.

Note that if your endpoint URL includes a `PORT`, that can also be included in the `--url` flag:

```
{{% vendor/cli %}} integration:add --type httplog --url "https://{{< variable "ELASTICSEARCH_URL" >}}:{{< variable "PORT" >}}/{{< variable "INDEX_NAME" >}}/_doc" --header "Authorization: Basic <basic_auth_token>" --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Once you've [added the service](../../add-services/_index.md),
to start forwarding logs [trigger a redeploy](../../development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

## Log levels

Your app may output logs with distinct severity levels.
But as Plaform.sh only reads logs from `stdout`,
this distinction is lost and everything gets logged at `INFO` level.

To preserve the original log level, use a language-specific syslog module/package for logging.

The following example code snippets show how logs can be written to Syslog:

{{< codetabs >}}

+++
title=PHP
+++

```php
openlog("", LOG_PID, LOG_LOCAL0);
syslog(LOG_INFO, "Operation started");
syslog(LOG_ERR, "Operation failed");
closelog();
```

<--->
+++
title=Python
+++

Using the logging module:

```python
import logging
import logging.handlers

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
handler = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(address="/dev/log")
logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.info("Operation started")
logger.error("Operation failed")
```

Using the Syslog module:

```python
import syslog

syslog.openlog(logoption=syslog.LOG_PID, facility=syslog.LOG_LOCAL0)
syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_INFO, "Operation started")
syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_ERR, "Operation failed")
syslog.closelog()
```

<--->
+++
title=Go
+++

Using the log package:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"log/syslog"
)

func main() {
	logger, err := syslog.NewLogger(syslog.LOG_LOCAL0|syslog.LOG_INFO, log.LstdFlags)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	logger.Println("Operation started...")
	logger.Fatalln("Operation failed")
}

```

Using the Syslog package:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"log/syslog"
)

func main() {
	syslogWriter, err := syslog.Dial("", "", syslog.LOG_LOCAL0|syslog.LOG_INFO, "")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer syslogWriter.Close()

	fmt.Fprintf(syslogWriter, "Operation has started")
	syslogWriter.Err("Operation failed")
}
```
