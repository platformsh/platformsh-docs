Learn about the image properties you can define in the an application configuration file.

The properties below are used to configure both a single-runtime image and a composable image. 

For settings that are unique to each image, refer to the [Single-runtime image](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#) and [Composable image](/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#) topics.
