The following properties are common to both the [single-runtime](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#top-level-properties) image type and [composable](/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#top-level-properties) image type. 

For most of these properties, the syntax and details are the same for both image types. Differences in meaning and syntax are noted where needed.
