To connect to your app using SSH keys, you need two keys:

* A **private key** you must keep _secret_
* A **public key** stored in your {{% vendor/name %}} account

A given SSH key pair can only be linked to a single user account.

A key pair is valid for as long as you have access to the private key on the system from which you are connecting.
If you have a key pair available, you aren't prompted to login.

To keep connection secure, you need to regularly update the keys you use.
A well-encrypted key is no substitute for regular key rotation.

If you used GitHub to sign up for your {{% vendor/name %}} account
your public keys from GitHub are automatically synced to your {{% vendor/name %}} account.
So you can use them already with the CLI or to [connect to your app](./_index.md#2-connect-to-an-app-with-ssh).

## Add SSH keys

If you don't have keys already added,
you might be able to [find existing keys](#1a-find-your-keys) or else you need to [generate new keys](#1b-generate-new-keys).

### 1A. Find your keys

If you haven't used SSH keys before or it's been a while since you created the key,
skip right to [generating new keys](#1b-generate-new-keys).

If you have generated SSH keys before and want to find them on your system,
follow these instructions.

A public key file has a name ending in `.pub`.
It contains seemingly random lines of characters,
like this example of a public [RSA key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29)
(note the email address at the end, which wouldn't be present in a private key):

```text
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC2nDRLgPANWParTiaGIgySG+thTtnqFGI1tMWyqDdfvH+5hL91w2tK9PzaP+NJ5hA/cOyh30YRFb52Y64toU16Ko5K1mLqNFJajjWEI5Y4VukG6betrWfqdQ7XBr/s7nBuDOFQ5+eKbvug4rRSCSo8CsEI1eI0VNQkC9HJWYK28k7KurMdTN7X/Z/4vknM4/Rm2bnMk2idoORQgomeZS1p3GkG8dQs/c0j/b4H7azxnqdcCaR4ahbytX3d49BN0WwE84C+ItsnkCt1g5tVADPrab+Ywsm/FTnGY3cJKKdOAHt7Ls5lfpyyug2hNAFeiZF0MoCekjDZ2GH2xdFc7AX/ your_email_address@example.com
```

To find your public key file:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.ssh
   ls -a
   ```

If you find a file ending in `.pub`,
copy the location and [add it to your {{% vendor/name %}} account](#2-add-an-ssh-key-to-your-account).

If you don't find an existing key, [generate new keys](#1b-generate-new-keys).

### 1B. Generate new keys

If you're logged in using the [{{% vendor/name %}} CLI](./_index.md#1-authenticate-with-the-cli),
generate a key and have it added to your {{% vendor/name %}} account automatically.

1. In a terminal, run `{{% vendor/cli %}} ssh-key:add`.
1. If necessary, log in to a browser.
1. Press `Y` and `enter` to create a new SSH key.
1. Copy the location of the generated key.
1. Run the following commands (replacing `{{< variable "PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY" >}}` with the location you copied):

   ```bash
   eval $(ssh-agent)
   ssh-add '{{< variable "PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY" >}}'
   ```

To generate a key otherwise, GitHub has a good [walk-through for creating SSH key pairs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on various operating systems.

Then you need to [add it to your {{% vendor/name %}} account](#2-add-an-ssh-key-to-your-account).

### 2. Add an SSH key to your account

Once you have the location of your public key, add it to your {{% vendor/name %}} account.

If you're logged in using the [{{% vendor/name %}} CLI](./_index.md#1-authenticate-with-the-cli),
in a terminal run the following command (replacing `{{< variable "PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY" >}}` with the location of your public key):

```bash
{{% vendor/cli %}} ssh-key:add '{{< variable "PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY" >}}'
```

{{% version/specific %}}
<!-- Platform.sh -->
You can also add it in the Console,
similar to this [video](https://docs.platform.sh/videos/management-console/add-ssh-mc.mp4).
<--->
<!-- Upsun -->
You can also add it in the Console.
{{% /version/specific %}}

Now you are ready to use the key to [connect to an environment](./_index.md#2-connect-to-an-app-with-ssh).

### 3. Connect to your server with SSH keys

To connect to a server using SSH keys, find the details in the Console:

1. Open the [{{% vendor/name %}} Console](https://console.platform.sh/).
1. Select a project.
1. In the **Environment** dropdown, select the environment you want to access.
1. Click the **SSH** dropdown.
1. Copy the ssh command for where you want access.
   (Example: `ssh abcdefghi5k-main-7rqtwti--app@ssh.us-2.{{< vendor/urlraw "host" >}}`)
1. Enter the command into a terminal.

Note that if you have just added your SSH key,
you need to [redeploy your environment](./troubleshoot-ssh.md#redeploy-your-environment) before you can access it using SSH keys.

## Forwarding keys by default

It may be helpful to set your SSH client to always forward keys to {{% vendor/name %}} servers, which can simplify other SSH or rsync commands.
To do so, include a block in your local `~/.ssh/config` file like so:

```text
Host *.us.{{< vendor/urlraw "host" >}}
       ForwardAgent yes
Host *.eu.{{< vendor/urlraw "host" >}}
       ForwardAgent yes
```

Include one `Host` entry for each {{% vendor/name %}} region you want to connect to, such as `us-2` or `eu-4`.
(You can include other configuration as desired.)
