To make changes to your app's code and test them without affecting your production environment,
set up a local development environment on your computer.

For the most effective testing, you want your local environment to match your {{% vendor/name %}} environments.
The best way to do this is to use a cross-platform tool based on Docker.
This ensures the changes you make locally appear as they would on your {{% vendor/name %}} environments.
It also means you don't have to worry about configuring your machine with
the various dependencies, certificates, and connections your app needs to run.

The **recommended tool** for local development with {{% vendor/name %}} is **[DDEV](./ddev.md)**.
The integration with DDEV is maintained by {{% vendor/name %}} to ensure it works smoothly.

Other Docker-based tools are also supported, such as [Docksal](./docksal.md) and [Lando](./lando.md).
If you choose to use a Docker-based tool, follow the steps on its page. Otherwise, follow these steps to run
your app on your computer.

## Before you begin

You need to have:

- A {{< vendor/name >}} account:
  new users can sign up for a [free trial account](https://auth.api.platform.sh/register)
- A working project
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- The [{{% vendor/name %}} CLI](../../administration/cli/_index.md)

## 1. Get your code

If you don't have your app code on your computer, download a copy.

1.  Get your project ID by running `{{% vendor/cli %}} projects`.

2.  Get the code by running the following command:

    ```bash
    {{% vendor/cli %}} get {{< variable "PROJECT_ID" >}} {{< variable "TARGET_DIRECTORY_NAME" >}}
    ```

    Or pull from your [integrated Git repository](../../integrations/source/_index.md).

You can now access your code from the project directory on your computer.
The CLI created a `{{< vendor/configfile "apps" >}}/local` directory that's excluded from Git.
It contains builds and local metadata about your project.

You can now make changes to your project without pushing to {{% vendor/name %}} each time to test them.
Instead, you can locally build your application using the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI.

Note that if your app contains services, you need to open an SSH tunnel to connect to them.
For more information, see how to [connect services](../../add-services#2-connect-the-service).

## 2. Connect to services

If your app requires services to run, you have two options for developing locally:

- [Tethered local development](./tethered.md) involves running your app on a local web server
  but keeping all other services on {{% vendor/name %}} and connecting to them over an SSH tunnel.
- [Untethered local development](./untethered.md) involves running your entire site locally,
  including all services.

Choose the option that works for you and get your services running.

## 3. Build your site locally

If you want your local development environment to be enclosed
so your main system remains unaffected by the build and its dependencies,
you can use a local virtual machine.

To build your site locally:

1.  Install any dependencies or tools needed for the build process.

2.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    {{% vendor/cli %}} build
    ```

    Your app is built in the `{{< vendor/configfile "apps" >}}/local/builds` directory.
    Unless you specify otherwise with the `--destination` flag,
    a symbolic link from your build is created as the `_www` directory at your project root.

3.  To check that the build was successful, move to the `_www` directory
    and run a web server.
