{{% ddev/definition %}}

This guide assumes you have a project already running with {{< vendor/name >}} and you have the code on your computer.

If you're starting from scratch, first [create a project from a PHP template]({{% create-project-link template=true %}}).

## Before you begin

{{% ddev/requirements %}}

## 1. Install DDEV

{{% ddev/install %}}

## 2. Add DDEV configuration to your project

Get basic configuration set up for your project by running the following command:

```bash
ddev config
```

If you started with a Drupal template, your repository already had DDEV configuration files.
Otherwise, you have to answer a couple of questions about what your repository is
so the correct files are added.

## 3. Add an API token

{{% ddev/token %}}

## 4. Connect DDEV to your project

{{% ddev/connect %}}

## 5. Optional: Get your project data

To get your environment data (files, database), run the following command:

```bash
ddev pull {{% vendor/cli %}}
```

To skip pulling files, add `--skip-files` to the command.
To skip pulling a database, add `--skip-db` to the command.

## 6. Run your project

Now your project is ready to run:

```bash
ddev start
```

This runs all your hooks and builds your project like on {{% vendor/name %}}.

The command returns the project URL `http://{{< variable "PROJECT_NAME" >}}.ddev.site/`
as well as a specific port on `http://127.0.0.1`.
To see your project running, open one of these URLs.

## What's next

You've got a project running on a local web server.
Now you can add customizations.
For more ideas and options, see the [DDEV documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

### Add environment variables

If your project requires environment variables for its hooks or runtime,
add them to the project's DDEV environment:

```yaml {location=".ddev/config.yaml"}
web_environment:
    - {{< variable "VARIABLE_NAME" >}}: {{< variable "VALUE" >}}
```

To apply your changes, run the following command:

```bash
ddev restart
```
