After your app is built, its file system is read-only.
This means that the only way you can edit your app's code is through Git.

However, you can transfer files to and from your built app without using Git.
To do so, you need to configure mounts or use an SSH client.

[Mounts](../create-apps/app-reference.md#mounts) let you set up directories that remain writable after the build is complete.
You can then transfer files directly to and from mounts inside your app
with a single command via the [{{< vendor/name >}} CLI](../administration/cli/_index.md).

Alternatively, you can transfer files to and from your built app using an SSH client 
such as `scp` or `rsync`.

## Transfer files using the CLI

### View the mounts inside your app

Before you start transferring files, 
you may want to view a list of all the mounts inside your app. 
To do so, run the following command:

```bash
platform mounts
```

The output is similar to the following:

```bash
Mounts on abcdefgh1234567-main-abcd123--app@ssh.eu.platform.sh:
+-------------------------+----------------------+
| Mount path              | Definition           |
+-------------------------+----------------------+
| web/sites/default/files | source: local        |
|                         | source_path: files   |
| private                 | source: local        |
|                         | source_path: private |
| tmp                     | source: local        |
|                         | source_path: temp    |
+-------------------------+----------------------+
```

### Transfer a file to a mount

To transfer a file to a mount using the CLI, you can use the `mount:upload` command. 

For example, to upload the files contained in the local `private` directory to the `private` mount,
run the following command: 

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount private --source ./private
```

You get the following output:

```bash
Uploading files from ./private to the remote mount private

Are you sure you want to continue? [Y/n]

  sending incremental file list
  example.sh

  sent 2.35K bytes  received 20 bytes  1.58K bytes/sec
  total size is 1.77M  speedup is 745.09
```

### Transfer a file from a mount

To transfer a file from a mount using the CLI, you can use the `mount:download` command. 

For example, to download a file from the `private` mount to your local `private` directory, 
run the following command:

```bash
platform mount:download --mount private --target ./private
```

You get the following output:

```bash
Downloading files from the remote mount private to ./private

Are you sure you want to continue? [Y/n]

  receiving incremental file list
  example.sh

  sent 2.35K bytes  received 20 bytes  1.58K bytes/sec
  total size is 1.77M  speedup is 745.09
```

## Transfer files using an SSH client

Another way to transfer files to and from your built app is to use an SSH client such as [`scp`](file-transfer.md#scp) or [`rsync`](file-transfer.md#rsync).

### scp

As a command-line utility, `scp` lets you copy files to and from a remote environment.

For example, to download a `diagram.png` file from the `web/uploads` directory 
(relative to the [app root](../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory)),
run the following command:

```bash
scp "$(platform ssh --pipe)":web/uploads/diagram.png .
```

The `diagram.png` file is copied to the current local directory.

To copy files from your local directory to the {{< vendor/name >}} environment, 
reverse the order of the parameters:

```bash
scp diagram.png "$(platform ssh --pipe)":web/uploads
```

For other options, see the [`scp` documentation](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html).

### rsync

You can use `rsync` to copy files to and from a remote environment.

For example, to copy all the files in the `web/uploads` directory on the remote environment 
to the local `uploads` directory,
run the following command:

```bash
rsync -azP "$(platform ssh --pipe)":web/uploads/ ./uploads/
```

To copy files from your local directory to the {{< vendor/name >}} environment, 
reverse the order of the parameters:

```bash
rsync -azP uploads/ "$(platform ssh --pipe)":web/uploads/
```

Note that `rsync` is very sensitive about trailing `/` characters.

If you're using UTF-8 encoded files on macOS, 
add the `--iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8` flag to your `rsync` call.

For more options, consult the [rsync documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html).
