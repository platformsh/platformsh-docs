Anything included in these guides applies to not only to Django, but also [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/), the content management system built with Django.

See an example Django project in the official [{{% vendor/name %}} Django template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/django4), which you can use as a starting point for your own project.

If you already have a Django project ready to deploy,
see the template's [example {{% vendor/name %}} files](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/django4/tree/master/.platform).
These files let you [configure your app](../../create-apps/_index.md),
[add services](../../add-services/_index.md), and [define routes](../../define-routes/_index.md).
