    Add a Solr server to your site and connect it to Drupal.

The Drupal [Search API Solr](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) module has a somewhat involved setup process, as it requires live access to the Solr server to generate the configuration files for it.
The following procedure is necessary to ensure each step can proceed.

Search API Solr stores its configuration in the Drupal Configuration API.
That system doesn't support environment-aware information.
So the setup process depends on config-overrides in `settings.platformsh.php`, which may need to be modified slightly depending on  your Solr configuration.

Search API Solr requires Solr 6.6 or higher, and recommends Solr 8 or higher.

Advanced Solr service configuration and implementation in frameworks other than Drupal can be found at the [Solr services page](../../add-services/solr.md).

## Steps

### 0. Upgrade Symfony Event Dispatcher

If you are running Drupal older than 8.8 and installing Search API Solr older than 4.1, a small workaround is needed.
The Solarium library used by Search API Solr requires the 4.3 version of the Symfony Event Dispatcher, whereas Drupal core ships with 3.4.
The Search API Solr issue queue has a [more detailed description](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr/issues/3085196) of the problem.

As noted there, the workaround for now is to run:

```bash
composer require symfony/event-dispatcher:"4.3.4 as 3.4.35"
```

in your project root and commit the resulting change to `composer.json` and `composer.lock`.
That will cause Composer to install the 4.3 version of Event Dispatcher.
Once [this issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2876675) is resolved in core, this step will no longer be necessary.

If you are using the latest version of Search API Solr and running Drupal 8.8 or higher on PHP 7.2 or higher, this step is no longer necessary. You should be able to proceed directly to the next step.

### 1. Configure the service

Configure the Solr server to have a single core (`maincore`) with the default configuration.
(This default isn't suitable for production, but enables connections.)
And define a single endpoint (`main`) that connects to this core.

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
searchsolr:
    type: solr:8.6
    disk: 1024
    configuration:
        cores:
            maincore: {}
        endpoints:
            main:
                core: maincore
```

### 2. Add the relationship

Use the `main` endpoint to define the relationship.

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
    solrsearch: "searchsolr:main"
```

### 3. Add the Drupal modules

You need to add the [Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api) and [Search API Solr](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) modules to your project. If you are using Composer to manage your Drupal site (which we recommend), run:

```bash
composer require drupal/search_api_solr
```

And then commit the changes to `composer.json` and `composer.lock`.

### 4. Add auto-configuration code to `settings.platformsh.php`

The configuration can be managed from `settings.platformsh.php` by adding the following code snippet.
It will override the environment-specific parts of the configuration object with the correct values to connect to the {{< vendor/name >}} Solr instance.

{{< note >}}
If you don't already have the [Config Reader library](../../development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app) installed and referenced at the top of the file, you need to install it with `composer require platformsh/config-reader` and then add the following code before the block below:

```php
<?php

$platformsh = new \Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config();
if (!$platformsh->inRuntime()) {
   return;
}
```
{{< /note >}}

* Edit the value of `$relationship_name` if you are using a different relationship.

* Edit the value of `$solr_server_name` if you want to configure a Solr server in Drupal other than the default server automatically created by Search API Solr module.

```php
<?php

$platformsh->registerFormatter('drupal-solr', function($solr) {
  // Default the solr core name to `collection1` for pre-Solr-6.x instances.
  return [
    'core' => substr($solr['path'], 5) ? : 'collection1',
    'path' => '',
    'host' => $solr['host'],
    'port' => $solr['port'],
 ];
});

// Update these values to the relationship name (from .platform.app.yaml)
// and the machine name of the server from your Drupal configuration.
$relationship_name = 'solrsearch';
$solr_server_name = 'default_solr_server';
if ($platformsh->hasRelationship($relationship_name)) {
  // Set the connector configuration to the appropriate value, as defined by the formatter above.
  $config['search_api.server.' . $solr_server_name]['backend_config']['connector_config'] = $platformsh->formattedCredentials($relationship_name, 'drupal-solr');
}
```

If you are connecting to multiple Solr cores, repeat the second block above for each relationship/server, modifying the two variables accordingly.

Commit all of the changes above and then push to deploy.

### 5. Enable the modules

Once the site is deployed, go to the `/admin/modules` page and enable the Search API Solr module.
The Solr Search Defaults module [has been deprecated](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr/issues/3283191#comment-14560497).

Manually create a Search API server with parameters similar to the following:

* **Server name**: `Solr Server`
* **Machine name**: `default_solr_server`
* **Enabled**: `yes`
* **Description** (optional): `Default Solr server created by the Solr Search Defaults module - config copied from https://git.drupalcode.org/project/search_api_solr/-/commit/1568d2b#4f547dbec1b001e0aa88f925637aa20132616c30`
* **Backend**: `Solr`
* **Solr connector**: `Standard`
* Configure _Standard_ Solr connector:
  * **HTTP protocol**: `http`
  * **Solr host**: `localhost`
  * **Solr port**: `8983`
  * **Solr path**: `/`
  * **Solr core**: `drupal`
  * **Query timeout**: `5`
  * **Index timeout**: `10`
  * **Optimize timeout**: `15`
  * **Finalize timeout**: `30`
  * **Commit within**: `10`
  * **Connector workarounds**:
    * **Version override**: `determine automatically`
    * **HTTP method**: `AUTO`
    * **Skip schema verification**: `false`
  * **Advanced server configuration**:
    * **Enable JMX**: `false`
    * **Enable JTS**
    * **solr.install.dir**: empty
* **Advanced**:
  * **Default result rows**: `10`
  * **Index single documents fallback count**: `10`
  * **Index empty full-text fields**: `false`
  * **Retrieve result data from Solr**: `false`
  * **Retrieve highlighted snippets**: `false`
  * **Suppress warnings about...**: `false`
  * **Fallback to multi-valued field types**: `false`
  * **All index prefix**: empty
  * **Targeted content domain**: `generic`
  * **Targeted environment**: `default`
  * **Optimize**: `false`
* **Multi-site compatibility**:
  * **Retrieve results for this site only**: `false`

If you choose to use a different server name, change the value for `$solr_server_name` in `settings.platformsh.php`.

### 6. Export and modify configuration

In the Drupal admin area, go to `/admin/config/search/search-api` and select your server.
(If you used the Search Defaults module, it's named "Solr Server").
First verify that the module can connect to your Solr instance by ensuring that the "Server connection" reports "The Solr server could be reached."

You can now generate a `config.zip` file using the button at the top of the page.
That produces a Solr configuration that is customized for your current field configuration.
Extract the file into the `.platform` directory of your site.
It should unpack into a directory named `solr_8.x_config` or similar.

Inside that directory, locate the `solrcore.properties` file.
In that file, *delete* the entry for `solr.install.dir` if it exists.
Its default value doesn't work, and it isn't required for Solr to operate.
(The server already knows its installation directory.)

Finally, move that directory to `.platform/`, and update the `maincore.conf_dir` to point to it.
The `services.yaml` entry should now look approximately like this:

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
searchsolr:
    type: solr:8.6
    disk: 1024
    configuration:
        cores:
            maincore:
                conf_dir: !archive "solr_8.x_config/"
        endpoints:
            main:
                core: maincore
```

Add the new directory and updated `services.yaml` to Git, commit, and push.

{{< note >}}
If you change your Solr configuration in Drupal, say to change the Solr field configuration, you may need to regenerate your configuration.
If so, repeat this entire step.
{{< /note >}}

### 7. Verify that it worked

Return to the Drupal UI for your server page.
After deploying and reloading the page, the "Core Connection" field should now read "The Solr core could be accessed".
