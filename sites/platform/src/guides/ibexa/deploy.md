description: Learn how to use Ibexa DXP on {{< vendor/name >}}.
---

Ibexa DXP is a Composer-based PHP CMS, and as such fits well with the {{< vendor/name >}} model.
As a Symfony-based application its setup is very similar to Symfony.

Ibexa DXP has come pre-configured for use with {{< vendor/name >}} since its predecessor, eZ Platform 1.13.
Version 2.5 and later is recommended.
Those are the only versions that are supported.
Appropriate {{< vendor/name >}} configuration files are included in the Ibexa DXP application itself, but may be modified to suit your particular site, if needed.

## Cache and sessions

By default, Ibexa DXP is configured to use a single Redis instance for both the application cache and session storage.
You may optionally choose to use a separate Redis instance for session storage in case you have a lot of authenticated traffic (and thus there would be many session records).

To do so, uncomment the `redissession` entry in the `.platform/services.yaml` file
and the corresponding relationship in the `.platform.app.yaml` file.
The bridge code that is provided with eZ Platform 1.13 and later automatically detects the additional Redis service and use it for session storage.

On a {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} instance, we strongly recommend using two separate Redis instances for Cache and Sessions.
The service and relationship names that ship with the default {{< vendor/name >}} configuration in Ibexa DXP should be used as-is.
To ensure the development environment works like Production, uncomment the `redissession` entry in the `.platform/services.yaml` file and the corresponding relationship in the `.platform.app.yaml` file.
The bridge code that's provided with eZ Platform 1.13 and later
automatically detects the additional Redis service and uses it for session storage.

By default, on {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} instances, both Cache and Session storage are in "persistent" mode,
so that data isn't lost in case of a system or process restart.
That reduces the potential for cache stampede issues or inadvertently logging people out.

## Modifying an existing Ibexa DXP project

If you have an existing Ibexa DXP project that was upgraded from a previous version, or want to resynchronize with the latest recommended configuration, see the [Ibexa DXP official repository](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform).

In particular, see:

* The [`.platform.app.yaml`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml) file,
  which automatically builds Ibexa DXP in development mode or production mode depending on your defined project-level variables.
* The [.platform](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/tree/master/.platform) directory.

## Local Development with eZ Platform 2.x and later

For local development on top of a Docker stack,
the eZ community provides a tool called [eZ Launchpad](https://ezsystems.github.io/launchpad/)
It improves developer experience and reduces complexity for common actions by simplifying your interactions with Docker containers.
eZ Launchpad is ready to work with {{< vendor/name >}}.

It serves as a wrapper that allows you to run console commands from within the container without logging into it explicitly.
For example to run `bin/console` `cache:clear` inside the PHP container do:

```bash
~/ez sfrun cache:clear
```

Note that eZ Launchpad is supported by the community.
It might also require adjustments to make it work for Ibexa DXP V4.

### eZ Launchpad installation

eZ Launchpad's approach is to stay as decoupled as possible from your development machine and your remote hosting whether you are Linux or macOS.
To install run:

```bash
curl -fLSs https://ezsystems.github.io/launchpad/install_curl.bash | bash
```

Then you can start to use it to initialize your Ibexa DXP project on top Docker.

```bash
~/ez init
```

or create the Docker stack based on an existing project

```bash
git clone <PROJECT_NAME>.git application
cd application
~/ez create
```

Find more details on the [eZ Launchpad documentation](https://ezsystems.github.io/launchpad/).

Now, you have a working Ibexa DXP application with many services including Varnish, Solr, Redis, and more.

### Integration

To generate the key files for {{< vendor/name >}} (`.platform.app.yaml` and `.platform`) run:

```bash
~/ez platformsh:setup
```

eZ Launchpad generates the files for you and you are then totally free to fine tune them.

#### Solr specificity

Solr is fully functional with eZ Launchpad but it isn't enabled by default on {{< vendor/name >}}.
You have to set it up manually following the [current documentation](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/master/.platform/services.yaml#L37).

Actions needed are:

* Generate the Solr configuration thanks to the script provided by Ibexa.
* Put the result in the `.platform` at the root of your project.
* Add the service in the `.platform/services.yaml`.
* Add the relationship in the `.platform.app.yaml`.

#### Environment variables (optional)

eZ Launchpad allows you to define environment variables in the `provisioning/dev/docker-compose.yml` file.
You may use that to set [variables](../../development/variables/_index.md) to match {{< vendor/name >}} environments so that you can keep your environment behavior in sync.

Such variables have to be set in the `engine` container.

```yaml
# provisioning/dev/docker-compose.yml
engine:
    environment:
        - ASIMPLEVARIABLE=avalue
        - PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS=A_BASE64_ENCODED_VALUE
```

### Local development with {{< vendor/name >}}

Thanks to eZ Launchpad, you can work 100% locally: [untethered](../../development/local/untethered.md).
You have the whole project working offline on machine.

{{< note >}}

{{< vendor/name >}} also provides smooth [tethered SSH tunnels](../../development/local/tethered.md).

{{< /note >}}

Local services are provided by the Docker stack but there are minimum day-to-day tasks that you might need with {{< vendor/name >}}.

The main ones are:

* **Downstream database synchronization**: Getting it from the remote to the local.
* **Downstream file storage synchronization**: Getting it from the remote to the local.

To help you with that, {{< vendor/name >}} provides a CLI that you can [install](../../administration/cli/_index.md).

#### Database and storage synchronization

```bash
platform db:dump --gzip -f ezplatform.sql.gz -d data/ -y
platform mount:download -m ezplatform/web/var --target=ezplatform/web/var/ -y
~/ez/importdata
```

The two first lines get the remote database and storage from the remote environment and stores it locally in `data/`.
The third tells to eZ Launchpad to import those data in the Docker stack.

{{< note >}}

The storage (images and files) synchronization is optional.
Ibexa DXP provides a [placeholder generator mechanism](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/content_management/images/images/#generating-placeholder-images)
that allows you to forget about the real images for your local.
