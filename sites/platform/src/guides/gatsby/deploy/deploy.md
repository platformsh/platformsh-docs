## Deployment

## Additional changes

A standard Gatsby site - either one created interactively through npm (`npm init gatsby`) or through a starter such as the [Blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) used in the {{% vendor/name %}} template - will generate a static site without the use of any external services. If this is your starting point you have all of the configuration necessary to deploy your project, but below are a few modifications that may help you develop your site more efficiently going forward.

### Install the Config Reader
