We recommend the latest [MariaDB](../../../add-services/mysql/_index.md) version for Drupal,
although you can also use Oracle MySQL or [PostgreSQL](../../../add-services/postgresql.md).
For Drupal caching, we strongly recommend [Redis](../../../add-services/redis.md).
Drupal's cache can be very aggressive,
and keeping that data out of the database helps with both performance and disk usage.
See an example of Redis for caching in our [Drupal template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal10).
