    Add some helpful dependencies, and modify your Quarkus site to read from a {{% vendor/name %}} environment.

Now that your code contains all of the configuration to deploy on {{% vendor/name %}}, it's time to make your Quarkus site itself ready to run on a {{% vendor/name %}} environment. There are a number of additional steps that are either required or recommended, depending on how well you want to optimize your site.

## Install the Config Reader

{{% guides/config-reader-info lang="java" %}}

Below is an example of how to install the Config Reader for Java using Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>sh.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>config</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.2</version>
</dependency>
```

and Gradle:

```txt
compile group: 'sh.platform', name: 'config', version: '2.2.2'
```

## `.environment`

The `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` file on the [previous page](/guides/quarkus/deploy/configure.md#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml) has been pulled directly from the [Quarkus template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/quarkus/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml). It is sufficient to deploy Quarkus on it's own, but since [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config) makes it possible to overwrite configurations without impacting the application itself, you might elect to rely more heavily on environment variables in it's place. 

Consider this simplified `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}l` file:

```yaml
name: app

type: "java:11"

disk: 1024

hooks:
    build: ./mvnw package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.package.uber-jar=true
    
web:
    commands:
        start: java -jar $JAVA_OPTS $CREDENTIAL -Dquarkus.http.port=$PORT target/file.jar
```

On {{% vendor/name %}}, we can set the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` by committing a `.environment` file to the repository's root. {{% vendor/name %}} runs `source .environment` in the application root when a project starts, and when logging into the environment over SSH.
That gives you a place to do extra environment variable setup before the application runs, including modifying the system `$PATH` and other shell level customizations.
It allows us to define `JAVA_OPTS` when running on {{% vendor/name %}}, but otherwise not be used during local development testing. 

```shell
# .environment
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```
