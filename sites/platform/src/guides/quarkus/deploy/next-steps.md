    Resources for further developing your site.

This guide has hopefully helped you deploy a new Quarkus site, or migrate an existing one, to {{% vendor/name %}}. It has made a few assumptions to provide the best information to do so, but is by no means a complete reference for your particular application. For this reason, the {{% vendor/name %}} team maintains and adds to a number of Quarkus guides that can help you add services like Elasticsearch and MongoDB to your application, or how to start using Panache and JPA. 

Consult those guides below or in the sidebar for more information.

- [Elasticsearch](/guides/quarkus/elasticsearch.md)
- [JPA](/guides/quarkus/jpa.md)
- [MongoDB](/guides/quarkus/mongodb.md)
- [Panache](/guides/quarkus/panache.md)
- [Redis](/guides/quarkus/redis.md)
