Notice that the build `flavor` is set to `composer`, which will automatically download WordPress core, as well as your plugins, themes, and dependencies during the build step as defined in your `composer.json` file. Since WordPress's caching and uploads require write access at runtime, they've been given corresponding [mounts](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts) defined for them at the bottom of the file. MariaDB is accessible to WordPress internally at `database.internal` thanks to the relationship definition `database`. The [WordPress CLI](https://packagist.org/packages/wp-cli/wp-cli) is added as a build dependency, but we will still need to add some additional dependencies in the next step so that it can be used by the application and via SSH.

{{< note >}}
During the template's build hook above, you see an `rsync` command that allows you to commit and use plugins that aren't accessible via Composer. The command moves all non-Composer plugins in a committed `plugins` directory to the final `wp-content/plugins` destination so that they can be enabled through the administration panel.

If you are migrating WordPress or starting from scratch, you should copy this line for your committed non-Composer plugins and, if needed, modify it to move committed `themes` to `wp-content/themes` in the same way.
