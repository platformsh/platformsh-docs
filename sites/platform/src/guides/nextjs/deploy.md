[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework for building websites and web apps,
with server-side rendering and static site generation.

See an example Next.js project in the official [{{% vendor/name %}} Next.js template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs).
You can use it as a starting point for your own project.

If you already have a Next.js project ready to deploy,
see the template's [example app configuration](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml)
and other [example {{% vendor/name %}} files](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs/tree/master/.platform).
These files let you [configure your app](../../create-apps/_index.md),
[add services](../../add-services/_index.md), and [define routes](../../define-routes/_index.md).
