In addition to the [basic functions you should be familiar with](./what-is-yaml.md), YAML allows for special tags.
{{< vendor/name >}} accepts certain custom tags to facilitate working with configuration files.

These tags work with {{< vendor/name >}} configuration files, but may not elsewhere.

## Include

Use the `!include` tag to embed external files within a given YAML file.

The tag requires two properties:

| Property | Type     | Possible values               | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| `type`   | `string` | `string`, `binary`, or `yaml` | See the descriptions of [strings](#string), [binaries](#binary), and [YAML](#yaml). Defaults to `yaml`. |
| `path`   | `string` |                               | The path to the file to include, relative to the directory the YAML file is in. |

### `string`

Use `string` to include an external file inline in the YAML file as if entered as a multi-line string.

For example, if you have a build hook like the following:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
    build: |
        set -e
        cp a.txt b.txt
```

You could create a file for the script:

```text {location="build.sh"}
set -e
cp a.txt b.txt
```

And replace the hook with an include tag for an identical result:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
    build: !include
        type: string
        path: build.sh
```

This helps you break longer configuration like build scripts out into a separate file for easier maintenance.

### `binary`

Use `binary` to include an external binary file inline in the YAML file.
The file is base64 encoded.

For example, you could include a `favicon.ico` file in the same folder as your app configuration.
Then you can include it as follows:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
properties:
    favicon: !include
        type: binary
        path: favicon.ico
```

### `yaml`

Use `yaml` to include an external YAML file inline as if entered directly.
Because `yaml` is the default, you can use it without specifying the type.

For example, you could have your configuration for works defined in a `worker.yaml` file:

```yaml {location="worker.yaml"}
size: S
commands:
    start: python queue-worker.py
variables:
    env:
        type: worker
```

Then the following three configurations are exactly equivalent:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
    queue1: !include "worker.yaml"
```

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
    queue1: !include
        type: yaml
        path: 'worker.yaml'
```

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
    queue1: 
        size: S
        commands:
            start: python queue-worker.py
        variables:
            env:
                type: worker
```

This can help simplify more complex files.

## Archive

Use the `!archive` tag for a reference to an entire directory specified relative to where the YAML file is.

For example, you might want to define a configuration directory for your [Solr service](../../add-services/solr.md).
You might do so as follows:

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
mysearch:
    type: solr:8.0
    disk: 1024
    configuration:
        conf_dir: !archive "solr/conf"
```

The `!archive` tag means that the value for `conf_dir` isn't the string `solr/conf` but the entire `solr/conf` directory.
This directory is in the `.platform` directory, since that's where the `services.yaml` file is.
The `solr/conf` directory is then copied into the {{< vendor/name >}} management system to use with the service.
