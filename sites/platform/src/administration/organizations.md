Organizations allow you to manage your {{% vendor/name %}} projects, users, and billing.
You can group multiple projects in one organization and manage them together.

To manage users within your organization, see how to [manage organization users](/administration/users.md#manage-organization-users).

## Manage your organization settings

As an organization owner, you can manage the basic settings for your organization such as its name and URL.

## Transfer project ownership

You can transfer your plan ownership to a different organization at anytime.
You have to be an organization owner or have the [manage plan permission](/administration/users.md#organization-permissions).

1. Make the new organization owner a [project admin](/administration/users.md#)
   for the project you want to transfer.
2. To ask for the transfer, from your organization account open a [support ticket](/learn/overview/get-support.md).

Once the transfer is completed, the new organization can administer all project settings and billing and receives future invoices.
Ownership transfer automatically transfers subscription charges to the new organization.

## Transfer organization ownership

To transfer an organization to a different owner, first make sure that user is part of the organization.
If they aren't yet, [add them](/administration/users.md#add-a-user-to-an-organization).
Then open a [support ticket](/learn/overview/get-support.md) from the current organization to ask for the transfer.

## Fixed and Flex organizations

### What is a Upsun Fixed organization?
Ideal for workloads that have consistent resource requirements with stable and predictable usage.
Users can select a plan with predefined CPU and Memory resources. You can not adjust these resources, nor scale them automatically. To increase capacity, you’ll need to upgrade to a higher plan.

{{< note theme="note" title="Fixed resources">}}

**Fixed:** Resource from the plan is applied to the production environment. For preview, the user has the default small size for all containers.

{{< /note >}}

### What is a Upsun Flex organization?
Ideal for workloads that evolve over time or have dynamic resource requirements. Flex will suit most use cases. Users will be able to allocate the exact CPU and Memory resources that your applications and services need. You can adjust these resources at any time, or configure them to adapt automatically. You are charged based on the resources you allocate.

{{< note theme="info" title="Flex resources">}}

**Flex:** Users can customize resources per container (per app or service) for **all** environments.

{{< /note >}}

### What can you do?
When creating a new organization, users will be able to select the organization type from a drop-down option based on their preference. Once the organization is created, users can manage their organizations like they do today.
