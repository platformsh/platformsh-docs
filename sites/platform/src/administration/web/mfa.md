For improved security, you can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the Console and CLI.
Organizations can also [enforce MFA over SSH for all their projects](../../development/ssh/_index.md#multifactor-authentication-mfa-over-ssh).

1.  In the [Console](../../administration/web/_index.md),
    open the user menu (your name or profile picture).

2.  In the **Security** tab,
    click **Set up application**.

3.  Select an MFA application and follow the instructions to complete the setup.
