Instead of starting your own Fastly subscription and [managing your CDN yourself](./fastly.md),
you can take advantage of a Fastly CDN provided by {{% vendor/name %}}.
For example, Dedicated projects include a managed Fastly CDN by default.
These CDNs are exclusively set up and managed by {{% vendor/name %}}.

To modify any settings for a managed Fastly CDN,
open a [support ticket](/learn/overview/get-support).
To add a managed Fastly CDN to your project,
[contact sales](https://platform.sh/contact/).

### Domain control validation

When you request for a new domain to be added to your Fastly service,
{{% vendor/name %}} support provides you with a [`CNAME` record](../../domains/steps/dns.md) for [domain control validation](../troubleshoot.md#ownership-verification).
To add this `CNAME` record to your domain settings,
see how to [configure your DNS provider](../steps/_index.md#2-configure-your-dns-provider).

### Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates

By default, Enterprise and Elite plans include two [TLS certificates](/glossary.md#transport-layer-security-tls),
an apex and a wildcard one.
This allows for encryption of all traffic between your users and your app.

If you use a Fastly CDN provided by {{% vendor/name %}},
you can provide your own third-party TLS certificates for an additional fee.

To do so, if you don't have one,
set up a [mount](/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts) that isn't accessible to the web.
Use an environment with access limited to {{% vendor/name %}} support and trusted users.
[Transfer](../../development/file-transfer.md) each certificate, its unencrypted private key,
and the intermediate certificate to the mount.
To notify {{% vendor/name %}} that a certificate is to be added to your CDN configuration,
open a [support ticket](/learn/overview/get-support).

If you need an Extended Validation TLS certificate,
you can get it from any TLS provider.
To add it to your CDN configuration, open a [support ticket](/learn/overview/get-support).

Note that when you add your own third-party TLS certificates,
you are responsible for renewing them in due time.
Failure to do so may result in outages and compromised security for your site.
