    # Introduction

    Upsun, formerly Platform.sh, is a container-based Platform-as-a-Service. Our main API
    is simply Git. With a single `git push` and a couple of YAML files in
    your repository you can deploy an arbitrarily complex cluster.
    Every [**Project**](#tag/Project) can have multiple applications (PHP,
    Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, etc.) and managed, automatically
    provisioned services (databases, message queues, etc.).

    Each project also comes with multiple concurrent
    live staging/development [**Environments**](#tag/Environment).
    These ephemeral development environments
    are automatically created every time you push a new branch or create a
    pull request, and each has a full copy of the data of its parent branch,
    which is created on-the-fly in seconds.

    Our Git implementation supports integrations with third party Git
    providers such as GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, allowing you to simply
    integrate Upsun into your existing workflow.

    ## Using the REST API

    In addition to the Git API, we also offer a REST API that allows you to manage
    every aspect of the platform, from managing projects and environments,
    to accessing accounts and subscriptions, to creating robust workflows
    and integrations with your CI systems and internal services.

    These API docs are generated from a standard **OpenAPI (Swagger)** Specification document
    which you can find here in [YAML](openapispec-upsun.yaml) and in [JSON](openapispec-upsun.json) formats.

    This RESTful API consumes and produces HAL-style JSON over HTTPS,
    and any REST library can be used to access it. On GitHub, we also host
    a few API libraries that you can use to make API access easier, such as our
    [PHP API client](https://github.com/upsun/upsun-sdk-php).

    In order to use the API you will first need to have an [Upsun account](https://auth.upsun.com/register/) 
    and [create an API Token](https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/cli/api-token/).

    # Authentication

    ## OAuth2

    API authentication is done with OAuth2 access tokens.

    ### API tokens

    You can use an API token as one way to get an OAuth2 access token. This
    is particularly useful in scripts, e.g. for CI pipelines.

    To create an API token, go to the "API Tokens" section
    of the "Account Settings" tab on the [Console](https://console.upsun.com).

    To exchange this API token for an access token, a `POST` request
    must be made to `https://auth.upsun.com/oauth2/token`.

    The request will look like this in cURL:

    <pre>
    curl -u platform-api-user: \
        -d 'grant_type=api_token&amp;api_token=<em><b>API_TOKEN</b></em>' \
        https://auth.upsun.com/oauth2/token
    </pre>

    This will return a "Bearer" access token that
    can be used to authenticate further API requests, for example:

    <pre>
    {
        "access_token": "<em><b>abcdefghij1234567890</b></em>",
        "expires_in": 900,
        "token_type": "bearer"
    }
    </pre>

    ### Using the Access Token

    To authenticate further API requests, include this returned bearer token
    in the `Authorization` header. For example, to retrieve a list of
    [Projects](#tag/Project)
    accessible by the current user, you can make the following request
    (substituting the dummy token for your own):

    <pre>
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <em><b>abcdefghij1234567890</b></em>" \
        https://api.upsun.com/projects
    </pre>

    # HAL Links

    Most endpoints in the API return fields which defines a HAL
    (Hypertext Application Language) schema for the requested endpoint.
    The particular objects returns and their contents can vary by endpoint.
    The payload examples we give here for the requests do not show these
    elements. These links can allow you to create a fully dynamic API client
    that does not need to hardcode any method or schema.

    Unless they are used for pagination we do not show the HAL links in the
    payload examples in this documentation for brevity and as their content
    is contextual (based on the permissions of the user).

    ## _links Objects

    Most endpoints that respond to `GET` requests will include a `_links` object
    in their response. The `_links` object contains a key-object pair labelled `self`, which defines
    two further key-value pairs:

    * `href` - A URL string referring to the fully qualified name of the returned object. For many endpoints, this will be the direct link to the API endpoint on the region gateway, rather than on the general API gateway. This means it may reference a host of, for example, `eu-2.platform.sh` rather than `api.upsun.com`.
    * `meta` - An object defining the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) [schema object](https://swagger.io/specification/#schemaObject) of the component returned by the endpoint.

    There may be zero or more other fields in the `_links` object resembling fragment identifiers
    beginning with a hash mark, e.g. `#edit` or `#delete`. Each of these keys
    refers to a JSON object containing two key-value pairs:

    * `href` - A URL string referring to the path name of endpoint which can perform the action named in the key.
    * `meta` - An object defining the OAS schema of the endpoint. This consists of a key-value pair, with the key defining an HTTP method and the value defining the [operation object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operationObject) of the endpoint.

    To use one of these HAL links, you must send a new request to the URL defined
    in the `href` field which contains a body defined the schema object in the `meta` field.

    For example, if you make a request such as `GET /projects/abcdefghij1234567890`, the `_links`
    object in the returned response will include the key `#delete`. That object
    will look something like this fragment:

    ```
    "#delete": {
        "href": "/api/projects/abcdefghij1234567890",
        "meta": {
            "delete": {
                "responses": {
                    . . . // Response definition omitted for space
                },
                "parameters": []
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    To use this information to delete a project, you would then send a `DELETE`
    request to the endpoint `https://api.upsun.com/api/projects/abcdefghij1234567890`
    with no body or parameters to delete the project that was originally requested.

    ## _embedded Objects

    Requests to endpoints which create or modify objects, such as `POST`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`
    requests, will include an `_embedded` key in their response. The object
    represented by this key will contain the created or modified object. This
    object is identical to what would be returned by a subsequent `GET` request
    for the object referred to by the endpoint.

    description: |
      User-supplied SSL/TLS certificates can be managed using these
      endpoints. For more information, see our
      [Third-party TLS certificate](https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/domains/custom/custom-certificates/)
      documentation. These endpoints are not for managing certificates
      that are automatically supplied by Upsun via Let's Encrypt.
  - name: Environment
    description: |
      On Upsun, an environment encompasses a single instance of your
      entire application stack, the services used by the application,
      the application's data storage, and the environment's backups.

      In general, an environment represents a single branch or merge request
      in the Git repository backing a project. It is a virtual cluster
      of read-only application and service containers with read-write
      mounts for application and service data.

      On Upsun, the default branch is your production environment—thus,
      merging changes to this branch will put those changes to production.
  - name: Environment Type
    description: |
      Environment Types is the way Upsun manages access. We currently have 3 environment types:
      * Development
      * Staging
      * Production

      Each environment type will contain a group of users and their accesses. We manage access,
      adding, updating and removing users and their roles, here.

      Each environment will have a type, pointing to one of these 3 environment types.
      See `type` in [Environments](#tag/Environment).

      In general:
      * Production will be reserved for the default branch, and cannot be set manually.
      * An environment can be set to be type `staging` or development manually and when branching.

      Dedicated Generation 2 projects have different rules for environment types. If your project
      contains at least one of those Dedicated Generation 2 environments, the rules are slightly different:
      * All non-dedicated environments in your project can be `development` or `staging`, but never `production`.
      * Dedicated Generation 2 environments can be set either to `staging` or `production`, but never `development`.
      * The default branch is not considered to be a special case.
  - name: Environment Backups
    description: |
      A snapshot is a complete backup of an environment, including all the
      persistent data from all services running in an environment and all
      files present in mounted volumes.

      These endpoints can be used to trigger the creation of new backups,
      get information about existing backups, delete existing backups or
      restore a backup.
      More information about backups can be found in our
      [documentation](https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/environments/backup/).
  - name: Environment Variables
    description: |
      These endpoints manipulate user-defined variables which are bound to a
      specific environment, as well as (optionally) the children of an
      environment. These variables can be made available at both build time
      and runtime. For more information on environment variables,
      see the [Variables](https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/variables/set/environment/create/)
      section of the documentation.
  - name: Project
    description: |
      ## Project Overview

      On Upsun, a Project is backed by a single Git repository
      and encompasses your entire application stack, the services
      used by your application, the application's data storage,
      the production and staging environments, and the backups of those
      environments.

      When you create a new project, you start with a single
      [Environment](#tag/Environment) called *Master*,
      corresponding to the master branch in the Git repository of
      the project—this will be your production environment.

      If you connect your project to an external Git repo
      using one of our [Third-Party Integrations](#tag/Third-Party-Integrations)
      a new development environment can be created for each branch
      or pull request created in the repository. When a new development
      environment is created, the production environment's data
      will be cloned on-the-fly, giving you an isolated, production-ready
      test environment.

      This set of API endpoints can be used to retrieve a list of projects
      associated with an API key, as well as create and update the parameters
      of existing projects.

      > **Note**:
      >
      > To list projects or to create a new project, use [`/subscriptions`](#tag/Subscriptions).
  - name: Project Variables
    description: |
      These endpoints manipulate user-defined variables which are bound to an
      entire project. These variables are accessible to all environments
      within a single project, and they can be made available at both build
      time and runtime. For more information on project variables,
      see the [Variables](https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/variables/set/project/create/)
      section of the documentation.
  - name: Project Settings
    description: |
      These endpoints can be used to retrieve and manipulate project-level
      settings. Only the `initialize` property can be set by end users. It is used
      to initialize a project from an existing Git repository.

      The other properties can only be set by a privileged user.
  - name: Repository
    description: |
      The Git repository backing projects hosted on Upsun can be
      accessed in a **read-only** manner through the `/projects/{projectId}/git/*`
      family of endpoints. With these endpoints, you can retrieve objects from
      the Git repository in the same way that you would in a local environment.
  - name: Domain Management
    description: |
      These endpoints can be used to add, modify, or remove domains from
      a project. For more information on how domains function on
      Upsun, see the [Domains](https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/domains/custom/)
      section of our documentation.
  - name: Routing
    description: |
      These endpoints access an environment's `routes:` section of the `.upsun/config.yaml` file.
      For routes to propagate to child environments, the child environments
      must be synchronized with their parent.

      More information about routing can be found in the [Routes](https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/routes/)
      section of the documentation.
  - name: Source Operations
    description: |
      These endpoints interact with source code operations as defined in the `source.operations`
      key in a project's `.upsun/config.yaml` configuration. More information
      on source code operations is
      [available in our user documentation](https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/app/source-operations/).
  - name: Deployment Target
    description: |
      Upsun is capable of deploying the production environments of
      projects in multiple topologies: both in clusters of containers, and
      as dedicated virtual machines. This is an internal API that can
      only be used by privileged users.
  - name: Deployments
    description: |
      The deployments endpoints gives detailed information about the actual
      deployment of an active environment. Currently, it returns the _current_
      deployment with information about the different apps, services, and
      routes contained within.
  - name: Third-Party Integrations
    description: |
      Upsun can easily integrate with many third-party services, including
      Git hosting services (GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket),
      health notification services (email, Slack, PagerDuty),
      performance analytics platforms (New Relic, Blackfire, Tideways),
      and webhooks.

      For clarification about what information each field requires, see the
      [External Integrations](https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/integrations/)
      documentation. NOTE: The names of the CLI arguments listed in the
      documentation are not always named exactly the same as the
      required body fields in the API request.
  - name: MFA
    description: |
      Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requires the user to present two (or more) types of evidence (or factors) to prove their identity.

      For example, the evidence might be a password and a device-generated code, which show the user has the knowledge factor ("something you know") 
      as well as the possession factor ("something you have"). In this way MFA offers good protection against the compromise of any single factor, 
      such as a stolen password.

      Using the MFA API you can set up time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP), which can be generated on a single registered device ("something you have") such as a mobile phone.
  - name: Subscriptions
    description: |
      Each project is represented by a subscription that holds the plan information.
      These endpoints can be used to go to a larger plan, add more storage, or subscribe to
      optional features.
  - name: Orders
    description: |
      These endpoints can be used to retrieve order information from our billing
      system. Here you can view information about your bill for our services,
      include the billed amount and a link to a PDF of the bill.
  - name: Invoices
    description: |
      These endpoints can be used to retrieve invoices from our billing system.
      An invoice of type "invoice" is generated automatically every month, if the customer has active projects.
      Invoices of type "credit_memo" are a result of manual action when there was a refund or an invoice correction.
  - name: Vouchers
    description: |
      These endpoints can be used to retrieve vouchers associated with a particular
      user as well as apply a voucher to a particular user.
  - name: Records
    description: |
      These endpoints retrieve information about which plans were assigned to a particular
      project at which time.
  - name: Support
    description: |
      These endpoints can be used to retrieve information about support ticket priority
      and allow you to submit new ticket to the Upsun Support Team.
  - name: System Information
    description: |
      These endpoints can be used to retrieve low-level information and interact with the
      core component of Upsun infrastructure.

      This is an internal API that can only be used by privileged users.

      summary: Get project activity log
      description: |
        Retrieve a project's activity log including logging actions in all
        environments within a project. This returns a list of objects
        with records of actions such as:

        - Commits being pushed to the repository
        - A new environment being branched out from the specified environment
        - A snapshot being created of the specified environment

        The object includes a timestamp of when the action occurred
        (`created_at`), when the action concluded (`updated_at`),
        the current `state` of the action, the action's completion
        percentage (`completion_percent`), the `environments` it
        applies to and when the activity expires (`expires_at`).

        There are other related information in the `payload`.
        The contents of the `payload` varies based on the `type` of the
        activity. For example:

        - An `environment.branch` action's `payload` can contain objects
        representing the environment's `parent` environment and the
        branching action's `outcome`.

        - An `environment.push` action's `payload` can contain objects
        representing the `environment`, the specific `commits` included in
        the push, and the `user` who pushed.

        Expired activities are removed from the project activity log, except
        the last 100 expired objects provided they are not of type `environment.cron`
        or `environment.backup`.

        Retrieve an environment's activity log. This returns a list of object
        with records of actions such as:

        - Commits being pushed to the repository
        - A new environment being branched out from the specified environment
        - A snapshot being created of the specified environment

        The object includes a timestamp of when the action occurred
        (`created_at`), when the action concluded (`updated_at`),
        the current `state` of the action, the action's completion
        percentage (`completion_percent`), and other related information in
        the `payload`.

        The contents of the `payload` varies based on the `type` of the
        activity. For example:

        - An `environment.branch` action's `payload` can contain objects
        representing the `parent` environment and the branching action's
        `outcome`.

        - An `environment.push` action's `payload` can contain objects
        representing the `environment`, the specific `commits` included in
        the push, and the `user` who pushed.
